// The Codex `[hooks]` config block that carries wmux's lifecycle bridge.
//
// Codex hooks are TOML, not a hooks.json — they live under `[[hooks.<Event>]]`
// in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (default `~/.codex/config.toml`). The schema is
// Claude Code's, transposed: an event name, a `matcher`, and a list of handlers
// with `type` / `command` / `commandWindows` / `timeout` / `async`.
//
// Verified on codex-cli 0.151.0 (2026-08-31) by writing this block and watching
// the bridge fire. Two things about it are not guessable from the schema:
//
//   1. TRUST. A hook Codex has not been told to trust does not run, and says
//      nothing about it — no warning, no "needs review" line, no non-zero exit.
//      Writing this block is therefore NOT installation; the operator must
//      approve the hooks in Codex before they do anything. The TS installer
//      (src/shared/configIO.ts + lifecycleIntegrations.ts) renders this exact
//      shape, mirrors this file's constants byte-for-byte under a lockstep
//      test, and reports "written, NOT trusted" until the bridge actually
//      fires — approve-then-verify, never write-and-report-success.
//   2. VERSION. 0.140.0 accepts this exact block, advertises `hooks` as a
//      stable feature, and fires nothing. 0.141.0 fires. Bisected; see
//      CODEX_HOOKS_MIN_VERSION.
//
// This module is data only — it writes nothing. `integrations/codex/README.md`
// owns the operator instructions.
