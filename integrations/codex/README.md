# wmux ↔ Codex CLI

Two independent bridges live here. They report the same turn boundary by
different routes, and you want **one** of them, not both.

| | `bin/wmux-codex-notify.mjs` | `bin/wmux-codex-hooks-bridge.mjs` |
|---|---|---|
| Registered as | `notify = [...]` in `config.toml` | `[[hooks.<Event>]]` in `config.toml` |
| Payload arrives | last argv token | stdin |
| Codex floor | any | **0.141.0** |
| Reports | turn complete | turn complete, turn start, session start, approval pause |
| Needs operator approval | no | **yes** (trust gate) |
| Installed by wmux | yes (`lifecycleIntegrations`) | yes — approve-then-verify, see *Installation* |

The notify program is what shipped first. The hooks bridge is the
replacement: it reports everything the notify program does plus turn start,
session start, and approval pauses.

## Why the hooks bridge exists

wmux decides "is this Codex pane done?" partly by scraping the terminal.
`src/main/pty/AgentDetector.ts` matches `^codex>\s*$` for idle and three
transcribed approval questions for `awaiting_input`. That holds until Codex
changes its TUI. The answer feeds notifications, the orchestrator's count of
what is still busy, and the blocking poll — so when it is wrong, the fleet
sends work to a pane that never stopped.

The notify program already reports turn-complete. What it cannot report is
turn *start* or session start, so a pane that has begun working is still
inferred rather than told.

## What Codex measurably does and does not give us

Measured live on **2026-08-31** against codex-cli **0.151.0** (and re-checked on
0.145.0-alpha.2, 0.143.0, 0.141.0, 0.140.0, 0.135.0) driving a stub Responses
endpoint, because the account on the measuring machine returns 402
`deactivated_workspace` and cannot complete a real model turn. The stub only
supplies the model's side of the wire; the hook machinery under test is
entirely local.

**Events in the enum** — `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`,
`PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
`SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`, `Interrupt`.

**Measured firing** — `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `SessionEnd`,
`PreToolUse` (2026-08-31); `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest` (2026-09-07,
codex-cli 0.153.4, PTY-driven interactive TUI — the only way to see an
approval pause, since `codex exec` forces `approval: never`). Everything else
is an enum member nobody has watched fire, and none of those is mapped. An
unmeasured event is not a signal.

**`Stop` is a turn boundary, not a session one.** This was the question the
whole spike existed to answer. Across two turns of one session, `Stop` fired
once per turn carrying that turn's `turn_id`, and `SessionEnd` fired separately,
once, with no `turn_id`. A first run whose model call failed produced
`SessionStart` → `UserPromptSubmit` → `SessionEnd` with **no** `Stop` at all,
which is the same fact from the other side: no completed turn, no `Stop`.

**The payload envelope is Claude Code's, verbatim.** `session_id`,
`transcript_path`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name`, `model`, `permission_mode`, plus
`turn_id` on turn-scoped events. Codex even normalizes tool names into Claude's
vocabulary — a shell call arrives as `tool_name: "Bash"`. A captured `Stop`:

```json
{"session_id":"01a0582a-…","turn_id":"01a0582a-…","transcript_path":"…/rollout-….jsonl",
 "cwd":"D:\\wmux","hook_event_name":"Stop","model":"gpt-5.6-sol",
 "permission_mode":"bypassPermissions","stop_hook_active":false,
 "last_assistant_message":"hi"}
```

**Pane environment is inherited.** `WMUX_PTY_ID` set on the Codex process
reaches the hook unchanged, so pane attribution works exactly as it does for
Kiro and Claude — as long as that Codex process runs the turn itself. Under
Codex 0.157+'s shared server it does not; see
[Shared Codex server](#shared-codex-server-1523).

**Resume binding is possible**, unlike Kiro. `SessionStart.source` is
`"startup"` on a fresh session and `"resume"` on `codex … resume`, with the
**same** `session_id`. So the bridge keeps the notify program's resume spool.

**The payloads carry content.** `prompt` (UserPromptSubmit),
`last_assistant_message` (Stop), `tool_input` (PreToolUse). wmux's bridges are
metadata-only, so none of it is read, logged, or forwarded — the allowlist in
`buildCodexHookEnvelope` is the enforcement, and the test asserts on the
serialized envelope so a future content-bearing field fails it too.

**Exit code 2 blocks.** The binary carries `PreToolUse hook exited with code 2
but did not write a blocking reason to stderr` and `hook returned invalid
pre-tool-use JSON output`. The bridge writes nothing and always exits 0.

### Two things that will waste your afternoon

**1. The trust gate is silent.** Codex will not run a hook it has not been told
to trust, and it does not say so. With an untrusted `[[hooks.Stop]]` in
`config.toml`, `codex exec` printed no warning, no "hooks need review" line, and
exited 0 — the hook simply never ran, and the config parsed clean. The only
signal that anything was wrong was the absence of output from the hook itself.
`HookStateToml { enabled, trusted_hash }` is the on-disk representation, and
`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` is the escape hatch.

**2. Neither the feature flag nor the CLI flag is a capability probe.**
0.135.0 and 0.140.0 both report `hooks  stable  true` from
`codex features list`, both accept `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, both
parse `[[hooks.*]]` without complaint — and both fire nothing. Bisected:

| version | hooks fire? |
|---|---|
| 0.135.0 | no |
| 0.140.0 | no |
| **0.141.0** | **yes** |
| 0.143.0 / 0.145.0-alpha.2 / 0.151.0 | yes |

Only the version distinguishes them, which is why `codexSupportsHooks()` gates
on the version and fails closed on anything it cannot parse.

### PermissionRequest, measured 2026-09-07

The event that lets wmux stop screen-scraping Codex approval pauses was finally
observed. `codex exec` forces `approval: never` and no config overrides it, so
the measurement drove the **interactive TUI** in a PTY (node-pty) against the
stub Responses endpoint, returning an `exec_command` call with
`sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"` — the model-side request for an
unsandboxed run, which is what raises the TUI approval dialog.

Firing order for one gated call, all events carrying the same `turn_id`:

```
PreToolUse → PermissionRequest → (operator approves in the TUI) → PostToolUse → Stop
```

A captured `PermissionRequest` (elided):

```json
{"session_id":"01a07ba6-…","turn_id":"01a07ba7-…","transcript_path":"…/rollout-….jsonl",
 "cwd":"/spike/work","hook_event_name":"PermissionRequest","model":"stub-1",
 "permission_mode":"default","tool_name":"Bash",
 "tool_input":{"command":"echo proof > /tmp/…","description":"write the spike proof file outside the sandbox"}}
```

Three facts that matter for the mapping:

- **`tool_name` is Claude-normalized** ("Bash"), like every tool event.
- **`tool_input.description` is the call's user-facing `justification`** —
  content, never forwarded (the bridge is metadata-only).
- **No `tool_use_id`**, unlike the `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` events firing
  around it.

The spike also surfaced two TUI-only dialogs the driver had to get past, worth
recording for the next person to drive this thing: a fresh cwd raises a
*directory trust* dialog (pre-answerable in config: `[projects."<abs path>"]`
with `trust_level = "trusted"`), and a version-update nag whose default option
runs `npm install -g @openai/codex` — pick Skip when driving a spike.

## What the bridge reports

| Codex event | wmux signal |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `agent.session_start` (with `source`) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `agent.user_prompt_submit` |
| `Stop` | `agent.stop` |
| `PermissionRequest` | `agent.awaiting_input` |

`PermissionRequest` maps to `agent.awaiting_input` — the same pane state the
three transcribed approval regexes in `AgentDetector.ts` produce — and **not**
to `agent.awaiting_permission`, which is reserved for wmux's own blocking
permission gate (#783: the daemon holding the bridge RPC open until a phone
resolves it), not the agent's local TUI dialog. The regexes stay as the
fallback for panes without a trusted hook; a pane with this bridge gets the
fact instead of the screenshot guess.

Deliberately unmapped, each for its own reason — the full argument is in the
`EVENT_TO_KIND` comment in the bridge:

- `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` — a spawn per tool call for a signal the server
  already throttles. And `PreToolUse` must **not** become `awaiting_input`
  the way Claude's does: Codex fires it on every tool call, gated or not, and
  has a separate `PermissionRequest` for the approval pause. Conflating them
  is the mistake #898 punished.
- `SessionEnd` — measured, but there is no `AgentSignalKind` for "session
  over", and `agent.stop` would be a lie.
- `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` / `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` / `Interrupt`
  — never observed firing.

## Installation

**Wired up — approve-then-verify.** `wmux setup-hooks` now installs both
Codex bridges. Writing the block is deliberately **not** the end of the
install, because Codex requires an operator to trust a hook before it runs,
gives no warning when it has not been trusted, and a programmatic installer
almost certainly should not be able to pre-trust its own hook. An installer
that wrote the block and reported success would be reporting a lie — the pane
would go on being screen-scraped and nothing would say so.

So the flow is:

1. `wmux setup-hooks` — writes the bridge to the stable managed location
   (`~/.wmux/hooks/wmux-codex-hooks-bridge.mjs`, refreshed on every run) and
   appends the marker-bracketed `[[hooks.*]]` block to `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`
   (default `~/.codex/config.toml`). It refuses to write when:
   - `codex --version` cannot be probed or is below **0.141.0** (fail closed —
     0.140.0 parses the block, advertises the feature, and fires nothing);
   - config.toml already has ANY `[[hooks.*]]` the wmux markers cannot claim
     (skip-if-foreign, the notify lane's rule applied one level wider);
   - the config is unparseable, or a hand-pasted wmux block is missing its
     end marker (the installer never guesses a region boundary).
2. **Approve** — start Codex interactively and approve the wmux hooks when it
   asks. Until then Codex silently runs nothing; wmux's status says so.
3. **Verify** — `wmux setup-hooks --status` reports the honest verdict:
   `WRITTEN but NOT trusted` until the bridge has actually fired after the
   block was written, `ACTIVE` once it has.

The verdict is evidence-based, not file-based: the installer stamps when it
wrote the block (`~/.wmux/codex-hooks-install.json`), and the bridge appends
one JSON line per firing to `~/.wmux/codex-hooks.log`. A log entry newer than
the stamp is the only thing that reads as installed — it proves the operator
approved AND Codex actually spawned the hook. Idempotent re-runs never move
the stamp, and a refresh that changes the bridge path resets it (re-approval
genuinely required, and the status says so).

Manual setup (no `wmux setup-hooks`) still works:

1. Check your version: `codex --version` must be **0.141.0 or newer**.
2. Copy the bridge somewhere **stable** — not the repo checkout:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.wmux/hooks
   cp integrations/codex/bin/wmux-codex-hooks-bridge.mjs ~/.wmux/hooks/
   ```
   The path goes into `config.toml` and into the trust hash Codex records
   against it. Pointing it at a working tree means moving, renaming, or
   re-cloning the checkout silently un-trusts the hook — and an un-trusted
   hook does not run and does not say so, which is the exact failure mode
   above. Re-copy after a `git pull` that touches the bridge, then re-approve.
3. Get the block (substitute the path you copied to):
   ```sh
   node -e "import('./integrations/codex/hooks/wmuxHooks.mjs').then(m=>console.log(m.renderCodexHooksToml(process.env.HOME + '/.wmux/hooks/wmux-codex-hooks-bridge.mjs')))"
   ```
4. Append it to `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (default `~/.codex/config.toml`).
   A manually-installed block has no install stamp, so `--status` counts ANY
   firing as active — the honest floor for a block wmux did not write.
5. Start Codex interactively and **approve the hooks when it asks**. If it never
   asks, the hooks are not registered — re-check step 4.
6. Confirm: run a turn, then look for `"outcome":"ok"` lines in
   `~/.wmux/codex-hooks.log`.

If you use this bridge, remove the `notify = [...]` line — otherwise every turn
reports `agent.stop` twice. The `HookSignalRouter` dedup window swallows the
duplicate, so nothing breaks, but the second spawn is pure waste.

## Shared Codex server (#1523)

Codex 0.157+ runs turns in one shared background server per account
(`codex app-server --listen unix:// --managed-daemon`), started by whichever
Codex needed it first and keeping that process's environment. A program Codex
spawns from that server — `notify` included — inherits the `WMUX_*` variables
of the pane that started the server, possibly a closed pane or a pane of
another wmux instance, not the pane whose turn finished. The payload names no
pane either.

Both bridges inspect their spawning process, skipping wrappers that re-run
an entry point, including sh, cmd and PowerShell command wrappers. A
pane-side `SessionStart` with confirmed top-level rollout metadata records the thread's pane,
workspace, surface, instance suffix and endpoint overrides under
`$CODEX_HOME/wmux-thread-owners` (default `~/.codex/wmux-thread-owners`). The
index is account-scoped because one app-server can serve several wmux
instances. It contains routing metadata only, never tokens or conversation
content. Writes are atomic. Starting or resuming another thread in the same
pane invalidates its previous ownership record; attaching a thread in another
pane transfers ownership there. Closing the pane removes its owner pointer.
Relay records use the account the relay actually attached, even if pane
environment variables name a different account.

For wmux-managed shared-server launches, the daemon also writes this index
from the TUI relay's confirmed foreground selection, before forwarding the
start/resume reply to the TUI. A live empty selection invalidates the old
record even after a restart; a transport interruption retains it. Invalidation
and publication failures abort selection forwarding. Old pointers are removed
before publication, so a full disk cannot leave a stale pair valid. This covers builds whose hooks
all run inside the shared server, without trusting those hooks' environment.

Shared-server notifications resolve the thread through that index and replace
all inherited routing fields with the recorded owner's fields. A missing owner
gets one 75 ms re-lookup before the signal is dropped. An unknown,
unreadable or invalidated owner is dropped without sending, logging under the
inherited instance, or writing a resume spool. There is no cwd fallback. A
shared-server hook cannot establish or overwrite ownership. A TUI launched outside the managed relay that only fires server-side hooks
has no proven owner, so its signals remain dropped.

A confirmed per-pane process (including a stdio app-server) always uses its own
pane environment, ignoring older registry records. Without a pane id it is
dropped, including a direct launch outside wmux. An uninspectable parent with
a pane id retains the legacy environment fallback, including permission hooks.
Hooks skip ancestor lookup when no identity is inherited; using an existing
owner in that case requires confirming a clean shared-server parent first. On WSL the launcher supplies the Linux parent's argv through
`WMUX_CODEX_NOTIFIER_ARGV`, and the same rules apply. This routing does not
require the user to pass `--no-daemon`.

Both entry points use `wmux-codex-thread.mjs` for rollout classification.
Sub-agent Stop and SessionStart hooks emit `agent.subagent_stop` without an
`agentSessionId` or transcript path; nested prompt and approval hooks are
ignored. An unconfirmed SessionStart cannot record ownership, and only a Stop
with confirmed top-level rollout metadata carries a resume-binding id. Each
hook classifies its rollout once and reuses that result. Shared sub-agent
notifications resolve the pane through the root
thread's ownership. They never replace the pane's resume binding or spool.
The shared module is shipped and installed beside both entry points.

### MCP and A2A identity under the shared server (#1778)

The wmux MCP server Codex spawns is the shared server's child too, so the
PID-map walk climbs through the server instead of reaching a pane, and its
inherited `WMUX_*` env names the pane that started the server. Codex names the
conversation on every `tools/call` in `_meta.threadId`. When a call carries a
thread id **and** the MCP server's parent is positively a shared app-server
(`app-server --managed-daemon`, or a non-stdio `--listen`; wrappers that
re-run the MCP entry itself are skipped), the server resolves that call's pane
from the ownership index above and requires it to be a live pid-map anchor of
this wmux instance. The parent must be the Codex executable itself (a node
shim or another program carrying the same arguments does not count). The
workspace is the one main resolves now. Nothing about it is cached, so a
resumed thread, a closed pane or a restarted server is seen on the next call.
The owner index is read from `CODEX_HOME`, which Codex does not pass to MCP
servers, so the server also derives it from the shared server's executable
path (`<CODEX_HOME>/packages/app-server-daemon/releases/<version>/bin/codex`).
The parent's argv comes from `/proc` on Linux and from `ps` `comm` plus
`args` elsewhere, so an executable path with spaces stays one token; an argv
line that cannot be aligned counts as uninspectable, not as another parent.

Where an owner can be recorded (the pane relay, off Windows), a call from a
shared server is identified by its thread only. The PID walks, the cached
identity, the commander token, the `WMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` / `WMUX_PTY_ID` env
hints, the external-client terminal claim and the process-wide computer-use
instance id are not used, and tools that would otherwise fall back to the
focused workspace (`pane_list`, `surface_list`, `pane_split`, `surface_new`)
fail instead. A call fails with a `Workspace identity unknown`
error that names the reason instead of acting as another pane when:

- its thread has no live owner (no owning pane, owning pane closed, another
  wmux instance);
- it carries no valid `_meta.threadId`;
- the parent process could not be inspected (a timeout or `ps` failure), or
  wmux is not reachable. Both are retryable, and an uninspectable parent is
  never remembered.

Any other parent — Claude Code, `codex --no-daemon`, a stdio app-server, a
script run by Codex's shell tool, an external MCP client — cannot claim a
thread id and keeps the existing resolution. A call without a thread id whose
parent could not be inspected also keeps it.

On Windows the pane relay is not used, so no owner is recorded for a session
behind the shared server. There a call whose thread has no owner record keeps
the existing resolution: the walk to the pane that started the server, which is
right for a single Codex pane. A thread that does have a live owner still
resolves to it. A Windows owner writer is a separate follow-up.

Diagnostics go to the MCP server's stderr: `identity: parent shared-server`,
`identity: codex-thread HIT ws=… pty=…` or `identity: codex-thread MISS <reason>`.

A thread has an owner only when a pane recorded one: wmux's own Codex launches
(through the pane relay, off Windows) and a pane-side `SessionStart` do. A
`codex` typed in a shell that starts or joins the shared server records none
(the shell guard from #1584 covers bash and zsh only), so off Windows its A2A
calls fail closed until it is started through wmux or with `--no-daemon`.

## Identity on the main pipe (#1111)

Both bridges send `clientName: 'wmux-hook-bridge'` on every request. On the
daemon control pipe it is ignored — there is no enforcer there. On the MAIN
pipe it is load-bearing: `hooks.signal` is `wmux.internal`, so no declaration
can ever grant it, and the enforcer instead recognises that exact name and
allows that one method (`src/main/mcp/hookBridge.ts`). Without it the signal is
refused as `identity-status:legacy` once the envelope-less grandfather closes,
and turn-state reporting degrades **silently** — the failure this integration
exists to remove.

The name is a literal in each bridge rather than an import, because a bridge is
a standalone `.mjs` outside the main build. `hookBridge.lockstep.test.ts` parses
the bridge sources to keep the copies honest; this bridge additionally carries
the same two assertions in `__tests__/codexHookEnvelope.test.ts`.

`hooks.signal` is the only main-pipe method either bridge calls. Adding another
means widening the lane in `hookBridge.ts` deliberately.

## Harmlessness

Both bridges are covered by `scripts/lib/hookHarmlessness.mjs`, which runs each
one against a fake daemon and requires it to classify identically to a no-op
hook: byte-empty stdout, exit 0, no surviving process, inside the latency
budget. The hooks bridge is exercised on all six measured events, including the
two it ignores — "ignored" has to mean silent and fast, not a slow no-op, and
`PreToolUse` fires on every tool call so a slow ignore there would be the most
expensive kind.
