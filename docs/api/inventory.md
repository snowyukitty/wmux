# wmux Public Surface Inventory

> **Baseline:** v2.18 line. Originally a Phase 0 deliverable for the Substrate 3.0 plan; kept current as the surface evolves.
> **Purpose:** one document that lists every RPC method, MCP tool, and event type wmux exposes to external tooling, with a `stability` tier so consumers can plan around what is and isn't covered by the v3.0 contract.
> **Companion docs:** [`reference.md`](./reference.md) (machine-generated method/event/capability tables — the always-fresh complement to this hand-curated doc), [`versioning.md`](./versioning.md) (semver + tier semantics), [`stability.md`](./stability.md) (v3.0 stable-surface guarantees), [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) (substrate contract).
>
> **What has shipped since the original Phase 0 draft:** the M0 metadata wire format (`expectedVersion`, `mergeMode`, per-pane `version`, the `pane.list` `{ asOfSeq, bootId, panes }` envelope) shipped in v2.9.0; the `agent.lifecycle` event shipped in v2.13.0; and the permission-enforcement points are live — points #1–#3 (method dispatch, metadata path write, event subscription) shipped in PR #71 (Phase 2.2) and run at method dispatch in `enforce` mode by default in production, while point #4 (`mcp.claimWorkspace` workspace scoping) predates the grammar and shipped in v2.7.2. These are no longer "planned" — see the per-row notes below and [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) §4. The one item still planned is a per-method stability-tier map in `system.capabilities` (today it returns the `paneMetadata` + `events` feature object only).

## Stability tiers at a glance

| Tier | Meaning | Breaking-change policy |
|---|---|---|
| **stable** | Covered by the v3.0 substrate contract. Wire shape + semantics frozen. | Only on a major version bump. Additive changes (new optional fields, new event types) allowed within a major. |
| **experimental** | Shipped and supported, but the wire shape or semantics may evolve before being promoted to stable. Includes Company Mode and the browser/CDP surface. | Breaking changes allowed within a major; release notes flag them. |
| **internal** | Implementation detail. Not part of the external contract. Documented here only so external tooling knows what *not* to depend on. | May change without notice. |

The stability tier is reported by `system.capabilities` in v3.0 (planned addition). Today, callers can read this document as the source of truth.

---

## RPC methods (JSON-RPC over Named Pipe)

Transport (see `src/shared/constants.ts` `getPipeName`/`getAuthTokenPath`/`getTcpPortPath`):

- **Windows:** Named Pipe at `\\.\pipe\wmux-<username>`, where `<username>` is `os.userInfo().username` (env vars aren't reliably inherited by MCP subprocesses, so the username comes from `os`, not `%USERNAME%`).
- **POSIX:** Unix domain socket at `~/.wmux.sock`.
- **Auth token:** the first request on every connection must carry the token from `~/.wmux-auth-token` (a plain UUID string, not JSON) in the `token` field. An unauthenticated request gets the socket destroyed.
- **Windows TCP fallback:** when the named pipe returns `EPERM` (some elevation scenarios), connect `127.0.0.1:<port>` with the port read from `~/.wmux-tcp-port` (see `PipeServer.startTcpFallback`). The same token authenticates.

The MCP host hosts these as tools (see [MCP tools](#mcp-tools) below). An *in-pane* plugin (spawned inside a wmux PTY) reads the token and endpoint from the injected env vars `WMUX_AUTH_TOKEN` / `WMUX_SOCKET_PATH` instead of the file. An *external-terminal* plugin reads `~/.wmux-auth-token` and derives the pipe name itself. Wire framing, rate limits, and the full security model are in [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) §5.

### Workspace surface

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `workspace.list` | — | stable | Returns all workspaces with their metadata. |
| `workspace.new` | `{ name?, cwd? }` | stable | Creates a new workspace. |
| `workspace.focus` | `{ id }` | stable | Switches the active workspace. |
| `workspace.close` | `{ id }` | stable | Closes a workspace (with PTY cleanup). |
| `workspace.current` | — | stable | Returns the active workspace id. |

### Surface (window) surface

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `surface.list` | `{ workspaceId?, includeStashed? }` | stable | Surfaces (terminals/browsers) in a workspace. Omitted ⇒ active workspace. `includeStashed: true` (#977) also returns surfaces of stashed panes; every row carries an explicit `stashed` boolean either way, and a stashed pane's surfaces always report `isActive: false` (nothing off-screen is focused). |
| `surface.new` | `{ workspaceId?, shell?, cwd? }` | stable | Opens a new surface in the active pane. External MCP callers SHOULD pass `workspaceId` to target their own workspace (#236 family); omitted ⇒ active workspace. Fails closed on an explicit unknown id. |
| `surface.focus` | `{ id }` | stable | Focuses a surface (resolved across all workspaces). |
| `surface.close` | `{ id }` | stable | Closes a surface by globally-unique id (all-workspace). |

### Pane surface (the core substrate read/write)

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pane.list` | `{ workspaceId?, includeStashed? }` | stable | Returns `{ asOfSeq, bootId, panes }` envelope. `includeStashed: true` (#977) also returns stashed panes — off-layout but still owned and still running. Every row carries an explicit `stashed` boolean; stashed rows add `stashedLiveness: 'alive' \| 'exited'`. NOTE: `stashed` is not the only reason a pane may be unmounted — a cold-parked workspace's panes are `stashed: false` and equally off-screen. `asOfSeq` is the EventBus seq at snapshot time; clients reconciling after `resync: true` drain events with `seq > asOfSeq`. `bootId` mismatch ⇒ drop all caches. |
| `pane.focus` | `{ id }` | stable | Focuses a leaf pane. |
| `pane.split` | `{ direction: 'horizontal' \| 'vertical', workspaceId? }` | stable | Splits a leaf pane. External MCP callers SHOULD pass `workspaceId` to target their own workspace (#236 family); omitted ⇒ active workspace. Fails closed on an explicit unknown id. |
| `pane.stash` | `{ id }` | stable (#977) | Takes a leaf pane out of the layout WITHOUT killing it — the daemon keeps the session and replays it on return. Refused when the pane is the only visible one, when it is empty (no session to keep and nothing to bring back), when there is no daemon connection, or when it holds an editor/diff tab whose unsaved state cannot be replayed. A validated commander caller is confined to its own workspace. |
| `pane.unstash` | `{ id }` | stable (#977) | Puts a stashed pane back beside its former neighbour. Idempotent — an already-visible pane is a success, so the retry a `PANE_STASHED` error asks for is always safe. Position ops (`pane.focus`, `surface.focus`) on a stashed pane are refused with `code: 'PANE_STASHED'` and a `recovery` payload naming this method; address ops (`input.send`, `input.readScreen`, `pane.close`, A2A delivery) work unchanged. |
| `pane.setMetadata` | `{ paneId?, workspaceId?, label?, role?, status?, custom?, mergeMode?, merge?, expectedVersion? }` | stable | External MCP callers SHOULD pass `workspaceId` (see `mcp.claimWorkspace`). **Shipped in v2.9.0:** `mergeMode: 'merge'\|'replace'\|'replaceShared'` (default `'merge'`; `custom` deep-merges one level on `'merge'`), the `expectedVersion` optimistic-concurrency guard, and a post-commit `version` echoed in the reply. Legacy `merge: boolean` still works (`true`→`merge`, `false`→`replace`); `mergeMode` wins when both are present. An `expectedVersion` mismatch returns `{ ok:false, error }` whose message contains `VERSION_CONFLICT` (with `currentVersion`). See [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) §1.3–§1.4. |
| `pane.getMetadata` | `{ paneId?, workspaceId? }` | stable | Reads metadata for a leaf pane. Returns `{ metadata, version }` — `version` is `0` when nothing was ever set (v2.9.0+). |
| `pane.clearMetadata` | `{ paneId?, workspaceId? }` | stable | Drops all metadata for a leaf pane; reply echoes the post-clear `version` (bumped monotonically, v2.9.0+). |
| `pane.search` | `{ query, regex?, workspaceId? }` | stable | Cross-pane content search within a workspace. Scoped to the caller's workspace. |

Validation limits live in `src/shared/types.ts` (PANE_METADATA_MAX_BYTES, PANE_METADATA_LABEL_MAX, etc.) and are reported on validation failure.

**`stash` (panes) vs `archive` (channels) are opposites, not synonyms.** A stashed pane is still RUNNING — it left the layout and nothing else. An archived channel is DEACTIVATED — read-only, one-way, no new posts. The two words describe contrary states, so do not treat a `pane.stash*` and a `a2a.channel.archive` as the same kind of event, and do not surface them under one label.

### Event bus

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `events.poll` | `{ cursor?, types?, workspaceId?, max? }` | stable | Pull events with `seq > cursor`. Returns `{ events, nextCursor, priorCursor, bootId, droppedCount?, resync? }`. See [Event types](#event-types) below. Polling, not push — stdio MCP transport doesn't carry server-initiated notifications cleanly. |

### Terminal I/O surface

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `input.send` | `{ text, ptyId?, workspaceId?, submit?, raw?, newTask? }` | stable | Send literal text to a pane's PTY. The role-enforcement reply fields `enforcedModel`, `enforcedOptions` and `note` are **experimental** (#1681), and so are the `newTask` param and the `freshContext`, `freshContextCommand`, `freshContextSignal` and `freshContextReason` reply fields (#1680); see [`stability.md`](./stability.md#inputsend). |
| `input.sendKey` | `{ key, paneId?, workspaceId? }` | stable | Send a control key sequence. |
| `input.readScreen` | `{ paneId?, workspaceId? }` | stable | Read the current visible terminal buffer. |
| `terminal.readEvents` | `{ paneId?, workspaceId?, sinceSeq? }` | stable | Read structured terminal output events (prompt detection, etc.). |

### Identity & capability

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system.identify` | — | stable | `{ app, version, platform, electronVersion }`. |
| `system.capabilities` | — | stable | Returns `{ methods: ALL_RPC_METHODS, features: { paneMetadata: { optimisticConcurrency: true, mergeModes: ['merge','replace','replaceShared'] }, events: { types: WMUX_EVENT_TYPES, maxRingSize: 1024, bootId } } }` (shipped). A per-method **stability-tier map** is still **planned** — it is not in the response today; this document remains the source of truth for tiers. |
| `mcp.claimWorkspace` | `{ name? }` | stable | **Creates** a dedicated workspace + PTY for an external MCP caller and returns `{ ptyId, workspaceId, workspaceName }` — it does not bind to an existing workspace (`workspaceId` is not a parameter). The caller pins subsequent calls to the returned `ptyId`/`workspaceId`; the user's active workspace is restored after creation. Added in v2.7.2 to prevent active-pane hijacking by external MCPs. See `src/main/pipe/handlers/workspace.rpc.ts`. |

### Display vocabulary (shared workspace state)

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `notify` | `{ title, body, type?, workspaceId? }` | stable | OS notification + in-app banner. `type` ∈ `'info'\|'warning'\|'error'\|'agent'` (default `'info'`); `title` and `body` are both required. |
| `meta.setStatus` | `{ text, workspaceId? }` | stable | Workspace-level status (shared display field). The field is `text`, not `status`. |
| `meta.setProgress` | `{ value, workspaceId? }` | stable | Workspace-level progress (shared display field). `value` is a number, clamped to 0–100. |
| `meta.setSkills` | `{ skills }` | stable | A2A agent self-description for `a2a.discover`. |

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) surface

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `a2a.resolve.identity` | `{ workspaceId? }` | stable | Returns `{ mappings }` — the current PID→ptyId map (from `~/.wmux/pid-map`) that a caller walks up its own process tree to resolve its owning workspace (PROTOCOL.md §6.1 path B). Not a finished identity; the pty→workspace edge is resolved live. |
| `a2a.whoami` | — | stable | The calling MCP's claimed identity. |
| `a2a.discover` | `{ filter? }` | stable | Lists other agents in the local wmux instance. |
| `a2a.task.send` | `{ to, paneId?, surfaceId?, title?, taskId?, message, execute?, silent?, data? }` | stable | `execute:true` is new-task only; approval is gated before task creation unless global A2A execute auto-approve is enabled. |
| `a2a.task.query` | `{ id }` | stable | |
| `a2a.task.update` | `{ id, status, result? }` | stable | |
| `a2a.task.cancel` | `{ id }` | stable | |
| `a2a.broadcast` | `{ kind, payload }` | stable | |
| `a2a.channel.list` | `{ workspaceId }` | stable | Lists channels in the caller's company. Closes Path D — explicit `workspaceId` is required (no `activeWorkspaceId` fallback). |
| `a2a.channel.create` | `{ workspaceId, name, visibility, topic?, createdBy }` | stable | Creates a channel and auto-adds the creator as a member (KTD10). Capability `a2a.channel.send`. |
| `a2a.channel.post` | `{ workspaceId, channelId, sender, text, clientMsgId?, data? }` | stable | Posts a message. Idempotent on `(channelId, clientMsgId)` (R13). Emits `channel.message` event on success; `PERSIST_FAILED` on writer failure. Capability `a2a.channel.send`. |
| `a2a.channel.join` | `{ workspaceId, channelId, member, includeHistory? }` | stable | Adds a member. Capability `a2a.channel.send`. |
| `a2a.channel.leave` | `{ workspaceId, channelId, memberId }` | stable | Removes a member. Capability `a2a.channel.send`. |
| `a2a.channel.archive` | `{ channelId, archivedBy, verifiedWorkspaceId }` | stable | Archives a channel (one-way; members retain history). HUMANS-ONLY: rides the renderer-only `channels:mutate-local` IPC, deliberately absent from the pipe router (like `kick`), so no agent/MCP caller can reach it. Daemon authz: caller must be a member or the company CEO (`createdBy` is metadata only). |
| `a2a.channel.get` | `{ workspaceId, channelId }` | stable | Returns the channel row. Capability `a2a.channel.read`. |
| `a2a.channel.getMessages` | `{ workspaceId, channelId, sinceSeq? }` | stable | Returns the channel's message list, optionally filtered to `seq >= sinceSeq`. Capability `a2a.channel.read`. |
| `a2a.channel.getMembers` | `{ workspaceId, channelId }` | stable | Returns the channel's member list. Capability `a2a.channel.read`. |
| `a2a.channel.nudgeRecorded` | `{ channelId, verifiedWorkspaceId, memberId }` | internal | Nudge-ledger report (v3.15.0): the renderer records a mention paste it just delivered, so the wake worker's re-nudge budget/backoff debits it instead of double-pasting the same member. Rides the renderer-only `channels:mutate-local` IPC; deliberately NOT registered on the main pipe router — a forgeable pipe caller could otherwise suppress another member's re-nudges (direct daemon-pipe reachability bottoms out at the same same-user ceiling as `kick`/`purge`, #113 documented residual). Best-effort: returns `recorded:false` when the wake worker isn't booted or the tuple isn't a live membership row. |

### Browser / CDP surface

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `browser.tabs` | `{ action, workspaceId, surfaceId?, url?, scope? }` | internal | Workspace-exact lifecycle backing for the bundled MCP `browser_tabs` tool. `workspaceId` is supplied by its strict caller-identity resolver and is not exposed as public tool input; the renderer re-checks surface ownership before select/close. The handler trusts the supplied `workspaceId` rather than binding it to the caller, which is exactly why the method stays reserved — see the note in `methodCapabilityMap.ts`. |
| `browser.open` | `{ url? }` | experimental | The browser/CDP surface backs the MCP `browser_*` tools. Wire shapes may evolve before v3.0. Currently the primary AI-agent capability driver, but not part of the substrate identity. |
| `browser.navigate`, `browser.goBack`, `browser.close` | various | experimental | |
| `browser.session.{start,stop,status,list}` | various | experimental | |
| `browser.type.humanlike`, `browser.type.cdp`, `browser.click.cdp`, `browser.hover.cdp`, `browser.drag.cdp`, `browser.press.cdp` | various | experimental | |
| `browser.cdp.target`, `browser.cdp.info` | various | experimental | |
| `browser.screenshot`, `browser.evaluate` | various | experimental | |

### Computer use surface

Desktop computer use ([design](../computer-use-design.md)). Off unless the user turns it on in Settings › Computer use (stored in `~/.wmux/computer-use.json`). Every app an agent observes or drives also needs the person's per-app consent, and password managers, terminals and agent apps, wmux itself and OS credential prompts are always refused. Errors cross the wire as `[code] message` with a code from `src/shared/computer/errors.ts`.

| Method | Params | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `computer.capabilities`, `computer.listApps`, `computer.listWindows` | `{}` / `{ app? }` | experimental | Capability `computer.observe`. Blocked apps are listed with a `blocked` reason and their window titles blanked. |
| `computer.getAppState` | `{ app, window?, mode? }` | experimental | Capability `computer.observe`. Returns a `snapshotId`, the accessibility tree text and/or a scaled window screenshot. |
| `computer.act` | `{ action, snapshotId, index? \| x?, y?, ... }` | experimental | Capability `computer.control`, the only input-injecting method. Targets only a snapshot the same agent took; x/y are screenshot pixels. One agent drives at a time; 120 actions per minute. |

The full list lives in `src/shared/rpc.ts` (`ALL_RPC_METHODS`). For the MCP-facing tool names (which are the actual external API for most consumers), see [MCP tools](#mcp-tools).

### Daemon (internal IPC, not part of substrate contract)

| Method | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `daemon.createSession`, `daemon.destroySession`, `daemon.attachSession`, `daemon.detachSession`, `daemon.resizeSession`, `daemon.listSessions`, `daemon.getAgentName`, `daemon.getAgentState`, `daemon.deliverScheduledPromptV2`, `daemon.readPromptEvents`, `daemon.ping`, `daemon.shutdown`, `daemon.compact` | **internal** | Used by the wmux Electron client to manage PTYs and perform incarnation/identity/input-atomic scheduled delivery. `daemon.getAgentState` exposes the daemon-minted session incarnation to the trusted client; the versioned delivery method requires it to match before PTY input and makes mixed-version clients fail closed instead of reaching the legacy unbound method. External tooling should not call these — use the pane/terminal surfaces instead. |

### Company Mode (deferred to Phase 4 gate)

| Method | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `company.{create, destroy, status, addDept, removeDept, addMember, removeMember, broadcast, sendDept, sendMember, message, save, restore, templates, worktreeSetup, mergeDept, provision, provisionAll, provisionCeo}` | **experimental** | 3-tier orchestration (CEO → Department → Teammate). Per the Substrate 3.0 decision (memory `project_company_mode_vision.md`), Company Mode is being re-evaluated at the post-v3.0 gate as a first-party reference orchestrator on top of the substrate, not a core wmux feature. |
| `company.a2a.{whoami, send, broadcast, inbox, ack, status}` | **experimental** | Company-scoped A2A surface. **Currently has no caller.** The six `company_a2a_*` MCP tools were its only entry point and have been removed (see [Company A2A (removed)](#company-a2a-removed)); no renderer, preload, or daemon path reaches these handlers. They are retained rather than deleted pending the Company mode re-evaluation. |

## MCP tools

The wmux MCP server (hosted in-process, named-pipe transport to the daemon) exposes a curated subset of the RPC surface as MCP tools. Tool names match `mcp__wmux__<tool>` when used from a Claude Desktop / Claude Code client.

### Tool profiles

The surface a server registers is chosen once, by a launch argument in the host config's `args` — never by an environment variable, so an env-stripping host cannot silently change it.

| Profile | Launch arg | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `full` | *(none)* | Every tool. **The default every registration writes.** |
| `core` | `--core` | `full` minus `browser_*` (and any `company_*`), for agents that never touch the browser. Saves roughly 27 KB of `tools/list` schema per session. An optimization, not a permission boundary — a core-mode agent has exactly the authority an ordinary one does. |
| `commander` | `--commander` | The orchestrator role surface. Set by the deck brain adapters at spawn time, not by host-config registration. |

`wmux mcp register --profile core` opts a host into the smaller surface; `--profile full` moves it back. Registration without `--profile` **preserves** whatever profile the entry already carries, so an automatic re-registration (app boot, bundle-path refresh after an upgrade) never undoes the choice.

### Substrate surface (stable in v3.0)

| MCP tool | Backs RPC method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pane_list` | `pane.list` | Returns the snapshot envelope `{ asOfSeq, bootId, panes }`. |
| `pane_metadata` | `pane.getMetadata` / `pane.setMetadata` | Merged `{action: get\|set}` form of the pane metadata read/write. `get` accepts the cross-workspace `workspaceId` override; `set` is the substrate write entrypoint. |
| `pane_get_metadata` | `pane.getMetadata` | Unlisted pre-merge alias of `pane_metadata {action:'get'}` — still callable via `tools/call` for one release. |
| `pane_set_metadata` | `pane.setMetadata` | Unlisted pre-merge alias of `pane_metadata {action:'set'}` — still callable via `tools/call` for one release. |
| `workspace_list` | `workspace.list` | |
| `surface_list` | `surface.list` | |
| `pane_split` | `pane.split` | Split a leaf pane (CREATE family — optional `workspaceId`, defaults to the caller's own; `direction` defaults to `horizontal`). Issue #285. |
| `pane_close` | `pane.close` | Close a leaf pane by globally-unique `paneId` (resolved across all workspaces). Rejects branch/root panes. Issue #285. |
| `pane_focus` | `pane.focus` | Focus a leaf pane by `paneId` — **non-yank** (does not switch the on-screen workspace; use `workspace.focus` for that). Issue #285. |
| `surface_new` | `surface.new` | Open a new surface (CREATE family — optional `workspaceId`/`shell`/`cwd`, defaults to the caller's own workspace). Issue #285. |
| `surface_close` | `surface.close` | Close a surface by globally-unique `surfaceId` (resolved across all workspaces). Issue #285. |
| `pane_stash` | `pane.stash` / `pane.unstash` | Take a leaf pane out of the layout, keeping its session running; `restore: true` puts a stashed pane back (idempotent — the remedy named by every `PANE_STASHED` error). Issue #977. |
| `pane_unstash` | `pane.unstash` | Unlisted pre-merge alias of `pane_stash {restore:true}` — still callable via `tools/call` for one release. |
| `terminal_read` | `input.readScreen` | |
| `terminal_read_events` | `terminal.readEvents` | Structured prompt-detected events. |
| `terminal_send` | `input.send` | `new_task` (experimental, #1680) maps to `input.send` `newTask`. |
| `terminal_send_key` | `input.sendKey` | |
| `wmux_events_poll` | `events.poll` | Pull-based event stream. |
| `wmux_search_panes` | `pane.search` | |
| `send_message` | inter-workspace messaging — send a message to another workspace. Backed by the same handler as `a2a_task_send` (an unlisted-but-callable literal alias). NOT `input.send` semantics. | |

### REPL surface (experimental)

Backed by **no RPC method**: the sessions are child processes of the MCP server itself, so nothing crosses the substrate boundary and there is nothing for the daemon to authorize. Scope is the caller's MCP connection — a session is not shared between panes or workspaces and does not survive a wmux restart. On the `full` and `core` profiles; deliberately absent from the commander surface.

| MCP tool | Backs RPC method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `repl_run` | *(none — in-process child)* | Evaluate JavaScript in a persistent Node runtime; variables, required modules, and open handles survive between calls. |
| `repl_reset` | *(none — in-process child)* | Kill a session and its state; the next `repl_run` starts a fresh runtime. |
| `repl_sessions` | *(none — in-process child)* | List the sessions this connection holds (cwd, pid, age, busy). |

### A2A surface (stable)

| MCP tool | Backs RPC method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `a2a_whoami` | `a2a.whoami` | Reports the calling workspace's identity (envelope-pinned). |
| `a2a_discover` | `a2a.discover` | Lists known workspaces and their advertised skills. |
| `a2a_set_skills` | `meta.setSkills` | Registers the calling agent's skill tags. |
| `a2a_task_send` | `a2a.task.send` | Sends a structured task to another workspace. Unlisted literal alias of `send_message` — same handler and shape, still callable via `tools/call`; use `send_message` in new prompts. |
| `a2a_task_query` | `a2a.task.query` | Pulls tasks by id / status / role (sender or receiver); flags `orphaned: true` when the addressed receiver pane is gone. |
| `a2a_task_update` | `a2a.task.update` | Transitions a task to working / completed / failed / input-required, or canceled by the receiver (with a reason). |
| `a2a_task_cancel` | `a2a.task.cancel` | Cancels a task you sent (sender-only). |
| `a2a_broadcast` | `a2a.broadcast` | Broadcasts an announcement to every workspace. |
| `channel_list` | `a2a.channel.list` | Lists channels in the caller's company. |
| `channel_create` | `a2a.channel.create` | Creates a channel and auto-adds the creator as a member. |
| `channel_post` | `a2a.channel.post` | Posts a message. Idempotent on `client_msg_id`. Surfaces `PERSIST_FAILED` (R7) instead of swallowing. |
| `channel_join` | `a2a.channel.join` | Joins a channel. |
| `channel_leave` | `a2a.channel.leave` | Leaves a channel. |

There is intentionally no `channel_archive` MCP tool: archiving tears a channel down for everyone, so — like kicking a member — it is a humans-only action that rides the renderer-only `channels:mutate-local` IPC and is never agent-reachable. Of the read-only pipe RPCs (capability `a2a.channel.read`), `a2a.channel.getMessages` and `a2a.channel.getMembers` are already surfaced as the `channel_read` and `channel_get_members` MCP tools; only `a2a.channel.get` is not yet exposed as an MCP tool. The history-shaping `channel.history` MCP tool is explicitly deferred per plan Scope Boundaries — pagination and streaming shape is unsettled.

### Company A2A (removed)

**Deprecation — the six `company_a2a_*` MCP tools (`whoami`, `send`, `broadcast`, `inbox`, `ack`, `status`) were removed from every profile.** They were never driven by any prompt, skill, or documented flow, and each one cost schema bytes in the `tools/list` every session pays for before it does any work.

**Company mode's UI is unaffected** — the panel, spawn, and the `company.*` provisioning/mutation RPCs behind them work exactly as before. **Company A2A messaging (the member inbox) currently has no caller**, however: these six tools were the only entry point into `company.a2a.*`, and no renderer, preload, or daemon path reaches those handlers. The pipe handlers are retained rather than deleted, pending the Company mode re-evaluation.

Two of the six have a direct workspace-level equivalent. The other four do not — department/CEO name routing, the member inbox, and the department tree were Company-mode-only features and are removed from MCP outright:

| Removed tool | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `company_a2a_whoami` | `a2a_whoami` |
| `company_a2a_broadcast` | `a2a_broadcast` |
| `company_a2a_send` | **No equivalent.** It resolved a target by department → lead, member name, or `"CEO"`; `send_message` / `a2a_task_send` only resolve workspaces. |
| `company_a2a_inbox` | **No equivalent.** The member inbox is a Company-mode store; `channel_read` / `channel_unread` read channels, which are a different store. |
| `company_a2a_ack` | **No equivalent.** `channel_ack` acknowledges by channel `seq`, not by the inbox `messageId` these took. |
| `company_a2a_status` | **No equivalent.** It returned the department tree with per-member roles; `a2a_discover` + `workspace_list` enumerate workspaces, which is not the same graph. |

### Browser / CDP (experimental)

| MCP tool family | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `browser_tabs` | 1 | Manages logical browser surfaces only in the calling session's workspace. `list`/`new` return stable opaque `surfaceId` values used by `select`/`close`; the former experimental numeric `tabId` index is no longer accepted. |
| `browser_request_help` | 1 | Hands ONE step to the human and blocks until they answer: a Done / Cancel bar on the browser pane plus a row in the Fleet inbox, for the login walls, CAPTCHAs, OTP fields, payment confirmations and consent screens an agent cannot get past. The result's last two lines are machine-readable (`help_state: completed | continued | cancelled | timed_out` and `url: <page url>`). One open request per surface; a second call is refused with `help_already_pending:`. The optional `completion` condition (`urlIncludes` / `selector`, polled every 500ms and honoured once it holds for 1s) is evaluated in the TOP frame of an in-window webview, so it is builtin-backend only and a selector inside a cross-origin iframe (a CAPTCHA widget, a 3-D Secure step) will never match — use `urlIncludes` for those. The whole tool returns `not_supported` on `external`. The deadline is enforced in the wmux main process, not by the caller. |
| Other `browser_*` tools (open, close, navigate, navigate_back, screenshot, fill, type, click, hover, drag, press_key, scroll, scroll_into_view, snapshot, smart_snapshot, console, cookies, dialog, download, evaluate, extract_data, extract_text, file_upload, highlight, network, pdf, resize, response_body, select, session, storage, trace, wait, wait_for_download, emulate) | ~31 listed | Wire shapes may evolve before v3.0. Backs Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI browser-control use cases. `browser_session {action}` merges the four `browser_session_*` tools (unlisted but callable for one release), and the seven `browser_repl` sub-steps (`navigate_back`, `hover`, `drag`, `select`, `scroll_into_view`, `highlight`, `dialog`) are likewise unlisted but callable — inside a `browser_repl` snippet they remain `await browser.X(args)` with the argument cheat sheet in that tool's description. |

### Computer use (experimental, opt-in)

| MCP tool | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `computer` | 1 | One tool with an `action` enum (`capabilities`, `listApps`, `listWindows`, `getAppState`, `click`, `setValue`, `type`, `pressKey`, `hotkey`, `scroll`) over the `computer.*` RPCs. Registered only in the `full` profile and only when computer use is turned on, so the default tool surface is unchanged. Strict input: unknown options are rejected. |

## Event types

The EventBus (`src/main/events/EventBus.ts`) is an in-memory ring buffer of `RING_CAPACITY = 1024` events with `POLL_DEFAULT_MAX = 256`. Workspace scoping is applied at poll time. Each main-process run has a `bootId` (UUIDv4) that invalidates client caches on daemon restart.

| Event type | Tier | Wire shape (key fields beyond `seq`/`ts`/`workspaceId`/`type`) |
|---|---|---|
| `pane.created` | stable | `paneId`, `parentBranchId?` |
| `pane.closed` | stable | `paneId` |
| `pane.focused` | stable | `paneId`, `previousPaneId?` |
| `pane.stashed` | stable (#977) | `paneId`. The pane left the LAYOUT; it still belongs to the workspace and its session is still running. Deliberately **not** `pane.closed` — a poller reading it as "gone" would drop a live session. The pane disappears from a default `pane.list` but is still returned with `includeStashed: true`, and stays addressable via `input.send` / `input.readScreen` / A2A. |
| `pane.unstashed` | stable (#977) | `paneId`. The pane is back in the layout. Paired with `pane.stashed` so the `pane.list` + `events.poll` recovery path never has an unexplained membership change. |
| `pane.metadata.changed` | stable | `paneId`, `metadata: PaneMetadata`, `version?` (monotonic; present from the main-process MetadataStore (v2.9.0+), absent from legacy renderer publishes — ignore events with `version` ≤ a previously seen value for the same `paneId`) |
| `workspace.metadata.changed` | stable | `metadata: WorkspaceMetadata`, `patch: Partial<WorkspaceMetadata>` |
| `process.started` | stable | `ptyId`, `pid?`, `shell` |
| `process.exited` | stable | `ptyId`, `exitCode`, `signal?` |
| `agent.lifecycle` | stable | `ptyId`, `kind: 'agent.stop'\|'agent.subagent_stop'\|'agent.awaiting_input'`, `source: 'hook'\|'detector'\|'osc133'`, `agent: AgentSlug\|null`, `decision: 'emit'\|'dedup'`, `exitCode?` (`osc133` only). **Carries `ptyId`, not `paneId`** — resolve `paneId` via a `pane.list` round-trip and cache. Shipped in v2.13.0. See `src/shared/events.ts` for the full per-source semantics. |
| `a2a.task` | stable | `taskId`, `from` (sender `workspaceId`; **also the base `workspaceId`**), `to` (receiver `workspaceId`), `kind: 'created'\|'updated'\|'cancelled'`, `state: TaskState` (`'submitted'\|'working'\|'input-required'\|'completed'\|'failed'\|'canceled'`), `messagePreview?` (≤200 chars, omitted by default). **Pointer, not payload** — fetch the body via `a2a_task_query`. **DUAL-PARTY scoped** (see note below). |
| `channel.message` | stable | `channelId`, `seq` (per-channel monotonic), `senderWorkspaceId`, `recipientWorkspaceIds: string[]`, `message: ChannelMessage` (sender / text / postedAt / `recipientSnapshot`). The `recipientSnapshot` field freezes the recipient set at critical-section entry in `ChannelService.post` (KTD3) — concurrent `join`/`leave` after the post starts do not retroactively change who sees the message. **MULTI-PARTY scoped**: base `workspaceId === senderWorkspaceId`; the poll filter adds every `recipientWorkspaceId` as an additional matchable key. An **unscoped** poll receives **zero** `channel.message` events. See [PROTOCOL.md §2.8](../PROTOCOL.md#28-workspace-scoping-and-the-a2atask-dual-party-exception) and `src/shared/events.ts` (`ChannelMessageEvent`). |

**`a2a.task` dual-party scoping:** unlike every other event type — which is scoped strictly to the calling workspace — `a2a.task` is visible to **both** the sending (`from`) and receiving (`to`) workspace, and to **no** third workspace. The base `workspaceId` is always set `=== from`, so a consumer that ignores `a2a.task` still scopes to the sender and never a third party; `events.poll` then adds `to` as a second matchable key for this type only (`src/main/pipe/handlers/events.rpc.ts` dual-party filter). An **unscoped** poll (no `workspaceId`) receives **zero** `a2a.task` events. The event is a pointer — `messagePreview` is omitted by default; the party fetches the body via `a2a_task_query`. See `src/shared/events.ts` for the typed shape.

**`channel.message` multi-party scoping:** generalises the `a2a.task` pattern to N recipients. A single post must reach every member workspace, so `events.poll` adds **every** `recipientWorkspaceId` as an additional matchable key for `channel.message` only (the `recipientWorkspaceIds` filter in `src/main/pipe/handlers/events.rpc.ts`). The base `workspaceId` is always set `=== senderWorkspaceId`, so a consumer that ignores `channel.message` still scopes to the sender and never a third party. An **unscoped** poll (no `workspaceId`) receives **zero** `channel.message` events. The recipient set is **frozen at critical-section entry** in `ChannelService.post` (plan KTD3) — concurrent `join` / `leave` on the channel after the post starts do not retroactively change who sees the message. Unlike `a2a.task`, the event carries the **full payload** (the `ChannelMessage` row), not a pointer — there is no `channel.message.query` round-trip required.

**`agent.lifecycle` source semantics:** `source:'hook'` is the Claude Code hook bridge (deterministic, sub-200 ms, always carries `agent`); `source:'detector'` is the regex `AgentDetector` (~1–2 s lag, carries `agent`); `source:'osc133'` is the shell-integration OSC 133 `D` marker (shell-agnostic, `agent` may be `null`, sets `exitCode` when the marker carried one). `decision:'dedup'` means a same-pane same-kind signal already fired inside the dedup window so no notification fanned out — the event is still published for observability. OSC 133 events are never dedup-gated (`decision:'emit'` always). Per-tool-call `agent.activity` and `agent.session_start` are intentionally NOT on this bus (they would overrun the 1024 ring).

**Ordering caveat:** `seq` is monotonic in **arrival order**, not in **causal order**. Two independent producers (PTYBridge in main process; paneSlice via preload IPC) write to the bus on different paths. Within one producer, order is preserved; across producers, a same-tick `pane.created` (renderer-published) and `process.started` (main-published) can land in the bus in either order. Clients must not assume seq order implies causal order across producer boundaries.

**Opaque cursor contract** (in force today, see [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) §2.2): cursor is **opaque**. Today it happens to be a monotonic 64-bit integer, but clients must pass back whatever `nextCursor` they received without interpretation. `cursor: 0` always means "replay from oldest in the ring." Only the future *encoding* change (sharded/segmented rings, PROTOCOL.md §8) is planned — opaque-cursor clients are unaffected by it.

## Identity / addressing model

| Identifier | Stable across daemon restarts? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workspaceId` | yes (session-persisted) | Stable. External tools should claim via `mcp.claimWorkspace`. |
| `paneId` | no (invalidated on `bootId` change) | Recreated per main-process run. Persisted in `session.json` but new ids are minted if the session restore fails partially. |
| `ptyId` | no | One-to-one with PTY processes; lifetime tied to the underlying shell. |
| `bootId` | no — that's the whole point | Stamped at EventBus construction. Mismatch ⇒ client drops all cached pane/pty ids and cursors. |
| MCP server name | yes | Used as the v3.0 plugin namespace anchor (`wmux.<server-name>.*`). |
| Token (Named Pipe / socket) | yes (rotated only on explicit rotate) | A plain UUID persisted at `~/.wmux-auth-token` with OS ACL restriction (Windows DACL rebuilt to owner-only on every load). See [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) §5. |

## What's intentionally not in this inventory

- **Daemon internals.** `src/main/pty/*`, `src/main/session/SessionManager.ts` — these are reachable through the public surfaces above but their internal contracts are not part of the substrate.
- **Renderer-internal IPC.** The `pane:*` / `workspace:*` channels used between Electron main and the renderer process are not part of the external surface. External tooling reaches the same state through the RPC surface.
- **CLI commands.** `wmux <command>` flags are stabilized separately. v3.0 stabilizes the JSON-output mode of a small set (`wmux mcp`) and defers full `--json --format` standardization to v3.1.

---

## How this inventory is used downstream

- [`reference.md`](./reference.md) is the machine-generated companion: it regenerates the full RPC-method, event-type, and per-method capability tables from `src/shared/rpc.ts`, `src/shared/events.ts`, and `src/main/mcp/methodCapabilityMap.ts` so the method/event lists can never silently drift from source. Regenerate with `node scripts/gen-api-reference.mjs`. This hand-curated inventory adds the tier classification and prose that the generator does not infer.
- [`versioning.md`](./versioning.md) cites the tier column.
- [`stability.md`](./stability.md) freezes the "stable" tier subset as the v3.0 contract.
- [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) elaborates on the wire contract for the stable surfaces.
- `system.capabilities` will report the per-method tier map programmatically in a future release; today it returns the `paneMetadata` + `events` feature object only.

### Change history

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-01 | Desktop computer use — added five `computer.*` RPC methods (**experimental**), the opt-in `computer` MCP tool, and the `computer.observe` / `computer.control` capabilities (risk class `computer`, critical). Per-app consent rides the approval queue as a new `computer-app` prompt kind. No new event type. |
| 2026-07-24 | Workspace-scoped browser tabs (issue #565) — defined a browser tab as a logical wmux browser surface and replaced the global Playwright-page inventory plus mutable numeric `tabId` with stable `surfaceId` addressing. The public experimental `browser_tabs` tool now resolves the caller workspace strictly; its reserved `browser.tabs` backing RPC re-checks ownership at the renderer effect boundary and is denied to commander-role callers because it multiplexes close. |
| 2026-07-05 | Channel delivery reliability (v3.15.0) — added the `a2a.channel.nudgeRecorded` daemon RPC (**internal** tier) to the A2A table: the renderer reports a just-delivered mention paste into the wake worker's shared nudge ledger, so an attached agent is not pasted AND re-nudged for the same mention. Renderer-only mutate path (`channels:mutate-local`), absent from the main pipe router by design. No new MCP tool, event type, or capability. |
| 2026-06-23 | Pane + surface lifecycle MCP tools (issue #285) — exposed five tools (`pane_split`, `pane_close`, `pane_focus`, `surface_new`, `surface_close`) mirroring the workspace-scoped pane/surface RPCs (#236/#238/#256/#257). CREATE family (split/new) takes an optional `workspaceId` (defaults to the caller's own workspace); ADDRESS family (close/focus) takes a globally-unique id resolved across all workspaces. Added the five to `FIRST_PARTY_METHODS`; the reserved `wmux.internal` `surface.new`/`surface.close` also widen `ALLOWED_RESERVED_FIRST_PARTY` per the §2.4 first-party security review. No new RPC method or capability. |
| 2026-06-21 | A2A channels (a2a-channels U2) — added nine `a2a.channel.*` pipe RPC methods (list, get, getMessages, getMembers, create, post, join, leave, archive) and six corresponding `channel_*` MCP tools. Added `channel.message` to the event table with the **multi-party** scoping rule (generalised from `a2a.task` dual-party): visible to the sender's `workspaceId` AND every `recipientWorkspaceId` in the frozen snapshot, never a third workspace, zero visibility on an unscoped poll. The recipient set is frozen at critical-section entry in `ChannelService.post` (KTD3). Updated PROTOCOL.md §2.8 with the parallel `channel.message` rule. |
| 2026-06-15 | Added `a2a.task` to the event table (`taskId`/`from`/`to`/`kind`/`state`/`messagePreview?`). It is tee'd from the A2A task store onto the EventBus and is the first event type with **dual-party** scoping — visible to both the sending (`from`) and receiving (`to`) workspace, never a third one, with zero visibility on an unscoped poll. Documented the pointer-not-payload contract (fetch the body via `a2a_task_query`). |
| 2026-06-09 | Baseline retargeted to the v2.18 line. Corrected the transport drift in the RPC-methods intro and the identity table: the pipe is `\\.\pipe\wmux-<username>` (Windows) / `~/.wmux.sock` (POSIX), the token lives at `~/.wmux-auth-token`, and the Windows TCP fallback (`~/.wmux-tcp-port`) is documented. Added `agent.lifecycle` (v2.13.0) to the event table with its `ptyId`/`kind`/`source`/`agent`/`decision`/`exitCode?` shape. Flipped `pane.setMetadata` `mergeMode`/`expectedVersion`/`version` from "v3.0 will add" to "shipped in v2.9.0"; documented the shipped `system.capabilities` feature object (per-method tier map still planned). Added the [`reference.md`](./reference.md) generated companion. |

---

## Permission gate (Phase 2.2)

Every RPC method maps to a single declarative entry in `src/main/mcp/methodCapabilityMap.ts`. The enforcer (`PermissionEnforcer.check`) consults this table at dispatch time to decide whether the caller's declared `wmuxPermissions` cover the request. See [`mcp-plugin-spec.md` §4.4](./mcp-plugin-spec.md#44-enforcement-contract-phase-22) for the wire contract and retry idiom.

The capability column below summarises the table. Three sentinels:

- `null` — identity-bootstrap / system-introspection method; no capability required. Any caller can invoke regardless of trust state.
- `wmux.internal` — reserved-prefix capability that NO plugin can ever declare (`permissionGrammar.ts` rejects `wmux.*` at declaration time). Internal-only surfaces, reached only through wmux's own curated lanes. Legacy callers (no `clientName` envelope) used to grandfather through; they are refused since #1111 closed that lane.
- `<capability>` — must match one of `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES` (spec §3.2).

### Capability map (subset — full table in code)

| Method | Capability | Path source | Risk class |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mcp.identify` | `null` (bootstrap) | — | — |
| `mcp.declarePermissions` | `null` (bootstrap) | — | — |
| `mcp.claimWorkspace` | `workspace.claim` | — | workspace |
| `pane.list` / `pane.focus` | `pane.read` | — | pane-lifecycle |
| `pane.split` | `pane.create` | — | pane-lifecycle |
| `pane.search` | `pane.search` | — | **terminal-content** |
| `pane.setMetadata` | `meta.write` | each present field → path | metadata |
| `pane.getMetadata` | `meta.read` | — (v3.0 reads whole record) | metadata |
| `pane.clearMetadata` | `meta.write` | shared paths (label/role/status) | metadata |
| `events.poll` | `events.subscribe` | `params.types` (`**` if absent) | events |
| `input.send` / `input.sendKey` | `terminal.send` | — | **terminal-input** |
| `input.readScreen` / `terminal.readEvents` | `terminal.read` | — | **terminal-content** |
| `meta.setStatus` / `meta.setProgress` / `meta.setSkills` | `meta.write` | — | metadata |
| `system.identify` / `system.capabilities` | `null` (bootstrap) | — | — |
| `browser.navigate` / `browser.open` / `browser.goBack` / `browser.close` | `browser.navigate` | — | browser |
| `browser.click.cdp` / `browser.hover.cdp` / `browser.drag.cdp` | `browser.click` | — | browser |
| `browser.type.humanlike` / `browser.type.cdp` / `browser.press.cdp` | `browser.type` | — | browser |
| `browser.screenshot` | `browser.screenshot` | — | browser |
| `browser.evaluate` | `browser.evaluate` | — | browser |
| `browser.session.status` / `browser.session.list` / `browser.cdp.target` / `browser.cdp.info` | `browser.read` | — | browser |
| `browser.session.start` / `browser.session.stop` | `browser.navigate` | — | browser |
| `a2a.whoami` / `a2a.discover` / `a2a.resolve.identity` / `a2a.task.query` | `a2a.read` | — | a2a |
| `a2a.task.send` / `a2a.task.update` / `a2a.broadcast` | `a2a.send` | `a2a.task.send` with `execute:true` requires `a2a.execute` | a2a |
| `a2a.task.cancel` | `a2a.send` | — | a2a |
| `workspace.list` / `workspace.current` | `workspace.read` | — | workspace |
| `workspace.new` / `workspace.focus` / `workspace.close` | `wmux.internal` | — | — |
| `surface.list` / `surface.new` / `surface.focus` / `surface.close` | `wmux.internal` | — | — |
| `daemon.*` | `wmux.internal` | — | — |
| `company.*` | `wmux.internal` | — | — |
| `notify` | `wmux.internal` | — | — |
| `hooks.signal` | `wmux.internal` | — | — |
| `usage.rateLimits` | `wmux.internal` | — | — |

Methods marked **bold** are surfaced in the approval dialog with stronger user-facing language (spec §3.6 — terminal-content / terminal-input risk classes).

The full machine-readable map (with path extractors and `multiPathMode` flags) lives at `src/main/mcp/methodCapabilityMap.ts`. `tsc --noEmit` enforces totality via `Record<RpcMethod, ...>` so a new RPC method without a map entry fails the build.

### Terminal launch and managed chat (internal, first-party desktop only)

`daemon.chat.launchTerminal` starts a fixed installed Claude/Codex CLI with an initial message and an optional agent-specific mode (`default`, Claude `bypass`, or Codex `yolo`) in the same pane. It requires an unchanged, positively empty POSIX shell prompt, fresh shell process attribution without children, and no pending approval. It never creates a managed session.

`daemon.chat.providers`, `daemon.chat.start`, `daemon.chat.reconnect`,
`daemon.chat.cancel`, `daemon.chat.respond`, and `daemon.chat.close` are private
main-process RPCs, guarded by the existing first-party client identity. They are
not exposed as public MCP tools or HTTP routes. Managed chat reuses the private
`daemon.transcript.*` read/send subscription surface; optional managed status,
request IDs, file previews, and history generations are defined in
`src/shared/transcript/`. See [managed chat](../managed-chat.md) for delivery,
retention, and capability semantics. A future mobile bridge needs its own
explicit authenticated contract; these methods grant no remote access.


`daemon.chat.skills` is first-party-only read-only discovery for an existing pane:
`{ id, agent: "claude" | "codex" }` → `{ state: "ready" | "partial" | "unavailable",
skills: [{ name, description, invocation, source }] }`. Cwd/account are resolved by
the daemon; arbitrary paths and provider RPC methods are not accepted. No public
MCP or phone HTTP route is added by this internal method.


Private desktop `chat:settings` accepts `{ptyId, choice?: {model, effort,
expectedRevision}}` and returns `{ok, settings?, error?}` for the existing native
Codex session. Read returns only model/effort/catalogue, busy state and a scoped
opaque revision. Write rechecks pane identity and runtime revision, rejects busy
or unsupported choices, and confirms the result by rereading the runtime.
It is not registered in the public RPC/MCP or phone HTTP routers.
