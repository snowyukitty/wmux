# Substrate Performance Characterization

> **Status:** Phase 1 characterization. Resolves the open profiling TODO in [`m0-design.md`](./m0-design.md) §8 Q5 and supplies issue #15 the missing honest perf numbers.
> **Bench harness:** [`scripts/substrate-bench.mjs`](../../scripts/substrate-bench.mjs).
> **Companion docs:** [`../PROTOCOL.md`](../PROTOCOL.md) §2 (event bus contract) and §3 (snapshot envelope), [`m0-design.md`](./m0-design.md) §8 (open questions).

## 1. Purpose

Two gaps motivated this characterization:

1. **`m0-design.md` §8 Q5 is open.** It asks:
   > `MetadataStore.snapshot()` performance under high write load: 1000 writes/sec for 60 seconds, then a `snapshot()` mid-burst — does it block the main process noticeably? If yes, the snapshot needs to be copy-on-write or use a different read pattern. Profile in M0-c.

   M0-c shipped the snapshot integration (`pane.list` returns the `{ asOfSeq, bootId, panes }` envelope) but the profiling note was never closed. This doc closes it.

2. **Issue #15 lacks honest perf numbers.** "Build a plugin/dashboard/orchestrator on top of wmux" needs concrete answers to: how fast can I write metadata, how fast can I poll events, at what backlog does the event ring drop, and does taking a snapshot stall the daemon. These are the questions a substrate consumer asks before trusting it under load.

The bench measures the substrate **end to end over the Named Pipe against the packaged production app** — the same path an external plugin uses — not the in-memory store in isolation. The numbers therefore reflect what a plugin actually observes, IPC and rate limiter included.

---

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Harness

`scripts/substrate-bench.mjs` reuses the isolation model from `scripts/m0-dynamic-verify.mjs`:

- Spawns `out/wmux-win32-x64/wmux.exe` with a temp `USERPROFILE`/`HOME`/`APPDATA`/`LOCALAPPDATA`, so `.wmux/`, the auth token, the pid-map, and the tcp-port file are sandboxed. `WMUX_DISABLE_CDP=true` keeps the browser engine out of the measurement.
- The win32 pipe name is shared per Windows account (`\\.\pipe\wmux-<username>`), so the bench pre-flights `pipeAlive()` and **aborts** if a real wmux daemon is already on it — two daemons collide on the single per-user pipe.
- Reads the token from `<TEST_HOME>/.wmux-auth-token` once the app writes it, then talks raw newline-delimited JSON-RPC over the pipe.
- **`clientName` = `wmux-bench`, with a seeded trust row.** The bench used to send no `clientName`: the request was recorded as `legacy` by `RpcRouter` and grandfathered, so it ran against the production **enforce-mode** app without tripping an approval dialog. #1111 closed that lane (in the first release on or after 2026-09-30), so the bench now identifies itself properly.

  The bench does not use the `wmux-cli` lane. That lane's curated allowlist covers neither `events.poll` / `pane.getMetadata` / `pane.setMetadata` (substrate-bench B2-B4) nor `pane.close` / `mcp.claimWorkspace` (perf-bench reap and hidden-flood) — and widening it is not an option, because `wmux-cli` is in `NON_IDENTIFYING_CLIENT_NAMES`: anyone may send that name, so every method added there is granted to every caller who claims it.

  **The seeded-trust pattern.** Each bench already owns a throwaway sandbox (temp `USERPROFILE`/`HOME`/`APPDATA`/`LOCALAPPDATA`, and for perf-bench a unique `WMUX_DATA_SUFFIX`), so before spawning the app it writes into that sandbox's `~/.wmux<suffix>/`:

  - `plugin-trust.json` — a `trusted` row for `wmux-bench` whose `declaredCapabilities` are exactly the capabilities its own calls require (`seedBenchTrust()` in each script; a bare capability with no `:glob` is an unrestricted grant for that capability). perf-bench declares `pane.read`, `pane.create`, `terminal.send`, `workspace.claim`; substrate-bench declares `workspace.read`, `pane.read`, `meta.read`, `meta.write`, `events.subscribe`.
  - `config.json` — pins `mcp.mode: "enforce"`, so the bench measures the production gate rather than the build's default.

  The row must exist before the app boots, because the very first RPC is already gated. The result is least privilege (only the declared capabilities, nothing else), no approval dialog, and no dependency on any lane that a non-identifying name can claim. `daemon.*` needs none of this — it is dispatched by the daemon control pipe, which has no enforcer.

  The same pattern is applied to the `a2a-*` dogfood scripts, with one wrinkle: those also call `wmux.internal` methods (`workspace.new`, `workspace.focus`, `surface.list`) that no declaration can ever contain, so they must keep the `wmux-cli` name for the curated lane and seed the declaration under that name for the methods outside it.
- Cleanup is SIGTERM then SIGKILL, awaited before exit so the temp HOME is removed.

Unlike the one-shot `rpc()` in the verification scripts, the bench keeps **long-lived sockets** (a small `PipeClient` that buffers on `\n` and correlates by request `id`) so it can issue many RPCs without paying a connect per call or tripping `MAX_NEW_CONNECTIONS_PER_SEC = 30`.

### 2.2 What is measured

| Scenario | Primitive | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| **B1** | `pane.setMetadata` | Sustained write throughput (writes/sec), per-write latency p50/p95/p99, and whether the echoed `version` stayed monotonic. |
| **B2** | `events.poll` | Round-trip latency p50/p95 at page sizes `max` ∈ {1, 32, 256, 1024} against a ring already loaded by B1. |
| **B3** | `pane.setMetadata` → `events.poll` | The real ring-overflow point: drive > `RING_CAPACITY` (1024) events between two polls, find the backlog at which `droppedCount` first appears, confirm `resync: true` + `droppedCount > 0`, and confirm recovery via `pane.list`. |
| **B4** | `pane.list` | Snapshot latency idle vs. mid-burst — the direct answer to §8 Q5. A background writer drives `pane.setMetadata` on one socket while a separate socket times `pane.list`; if `snapshot()` blocked the main process, mid-burst `pane.list` p95 would spike. |

Latency is wall-clock round-trip on the client socket (`process.hrtime`), so it includes JSON serialization, pipe transit, the handler, the synchronous store critical section, the synchronous `metadata.json` persist, and the reply. That is the honest "what the plugin feels" number, not an isolated store microbenchmark.

### 2.3 The rate-limit caveat (read this before quoting B1)

`PipeServer` enforces two wire caps (verified in `src/main/pipe/PipeServer.ts`):

- **per-socket: 50 rpc/s** (`limit.count > 50` → `error: 'rate limited'`)
- **global: 200 rpc/s** across all sockets (`error: 'rate limited (global)'`)

These bound *external* throughput far below the store's internal capacity. A single-threaded synchronous `MetadataStore.set()` can commit writes much faster than 50/s; the pipe just won't let one socket send them. So:

- **B1 is paced under the cap — and sequential.** The bench paces a single socket to just under the per-socket cap (`PER_SOCKET_RATE − 2`) so the loop measures store + IPC *latency* rather than the rate limiter rejecting requests, and it **awaits each write (then sleeps to the pace gap) before dispatching the next**. The achieved writes/sec is therefore bounded by the loop's dispatch cadence — reply latency plus sleep-timer granularity (Windows timers are ~15 ms coarse) — and only reaches the pace ceiling when that cadence allows. In the §3 run it did not: the figure is **cadence-bound below the ceiling**, not the wire cap and not the store ceiling. The latency percentiles are the real per-write cost either way; the bench output labels which bound was hit.
- **B3 and B4 use two sockets** (~2 × 48/s ≈ 96/s) to roughly double event-emission throughput while staying under the 200/s global cap.
- The §8 Q5 spec of "1000 writes/sec" is **not reachable by a single external socket** by design — that rate is an internal-store figure. The bench characterizes the externally-observable substrate; the store's own headroom above the cap is argued from source in §4, not benchmarked over the wire (you cannot push 1000/s through a 50/s socket without measuring the rate limiter instead of the store).

The `--duration` flag sets the B1/B4 burst window (default 10s). Run with a longer window for steadier percentiles.

### 2.4 How to run

Single line, PowerShell (package first — the bench needs the asar bundle):

```
npm run package; node scripts/substrate-bench.mjs --json out\substrate-bench.json
```

The bench prints a results table and emits machine-readable JSON both to `--json <path>` and to stdout between `----- BENCH_JSON_BEGIN -----` / `----- BENCH_JSON_END -----` markers, so the numbers below can be lifted in verbatim.

## 3. Results

> Numbers below are from one bench run on the environment noted. They are environment-dependent (pipe IPC latency, CPU, disk — each write persists `metadata.json` synchronously); re-run on the target machine before quoting. Re-generate verbatim with the §2.4 command and lift the values from the `BENCH_JSON` block.

Environment: `win32, Node v22.21.1, packaged app build 2.17.1 (out/wmux-win32-x64), --duration 10s, run 2026-06-10`

| `pane.list` idle p50 / p95 | 1.718 ms / 3.933 ms |
| `pane.list` mid-burst p50 / p95 | 1.616 ms / 6.354 ms |
| mid-burst / idle p95 ratio | 1.616x (no copy-on-write needed — see §4.3 caveat) |
| concurrent writes completed during the burst | 306 |

## 4. Analysis — expected behavior grounded in source

The architecture predicts the shape of these results before the bench runs. Each claim below cites the source that backs it.

### 4.1 Writes serialize in a synchronous critical section

`MetadataStore.set()` (`src/main/metadata/MetadataStore.ts`) is one synchronous critical section: validate → concurrency check → merge → bump version → commit to the in-memory `Map` → persist → emit. There are no `await`s between validation and commit. Single-threaded JS therefore serializes all writers at the event-loop boundary — MCP, pipe RPC, and the renderer bridge all enter the same `set()` with no preemption (m0-design.md §4 race #5). Consequences:

- **`version` is strictly monotonic per pane** (B1 verifies this). Two concurrent `pane.setMetadata` calls cannot interleave inside `set()`, so neither can observe a torn version.
- **Write latency is dominated by the synchronous persist + IPC, not by lock contention** — there is no lock. The per-write cost the bench sees is: pipe transit + `JSON.stringify(merged).length` byte-cap check + the synchronous `metadata.json` write (persist-then-publish, m0-design.md §3) + the reply.

### 4.2 The wire caps, not the store, bound external throughput

The store can commit far more than 50 writes/s — a synchronous in-memory `Map.set` plus a small JSON write is sub-millisecond. The binding constraint for an external client is the `PipeServer` per-socket cap of 50 rpc/s (and 200 rpc/s global). So the practical external bottleneck is **the rate limiter + IPC, not the store**. B1's writes/sec figure sits at or below that cap (cadence-bound in the §3 run — see §2.3); the store has headroom above it that an external single socket cannot exercise. The §8 Q5 "1000 writes/sec" figure is an internal-store rate; reaching it over the wire would require ~20 sockets and would hit the 200/s global cap first.

### 4.3 `snapshot()` does not block the write path (the §8 Q5 answer)

`MetadataStore.snapshot()` iterates the in-memory `Map`, clones each entry, and reads `eventBus.latestSeq()` + `eventBus.bootId` — all in-memory, all synchronous, no I/O (`src/main/metadata/MetadataStore.ts`). Because it is synchronous and the store map is in-memory, a snapshot cannot be *preempted* by a concurrent write, and a write cannot be preempted by a snapshot — single-threaded JS runs each to completion. The only interaction is that a `pane.list` and a `pane.setMetadata` queued at the same tick run back-to-back, each adding its own latency to the other's wait, not multiplying it.

So the §8 Q5 question — "does a snapshot mid-burst block the main process noticeably?" — has a structural answer: **no copy-on-write is needed.** The snapshot is O(panes) in clone cost and O(1) in seq/bootId reads; it never awaits. B4 confirms this empirically, with the nuance the prediction anticipated: **mid-burst p50 is flat** (1.616 ms vs. 1.718 ms idle — the median snapshot is no slower under concurrent writes, exactly what "no blocking" predicts), while **p95 rises to 1.616x idle** (6.354 ms vs. 3.933 ms). That tail elevation is the IPC dispatch queue, not the store: both `pane.list` and the background writer share one main-process event loop, so a snapshot occasionally queues behind a write (and vice versa) and pays that one write's latency as added wait — they run back-to-back, not concurrently, so the tail widens while the median holds. A *store-blocking* failure would have moved the median too. The ratio scales with concurrent traffic and pane count, not with any shared lock — there is none.

**Caveat on pane count.** This harness has one pane, so B4's snapshot cost is a floor, not a worst case. Snapshot clone cost is O(number of panes with metadata): `snapshot()` walks the whole map and clones each `metadata` object. A daemon with hundreds of metadata-bearing panes pays proportionally more per `pane.list`. That cost is still synchronous and non-blocking in the preemption sense, but it lengthens the single critical section. See §5.

### 4.4 `events.poll` is O(ring size) per call

`EventBus.poll()` (`src/main/events/EventBus.ts`) walks from the oldest live entry to newest, scanning up to `size` entries (capped at `RING_CAPACITY = 1024`), applying the type/workspace filters, and stopping at `max` matches. It tracks `lastScannedSeq` so a filtered subscriber does not re-scan unmatched entries on the next poll (PROTOCOL.md §2.3). Consequences for B2:

- Poll cost is bounded by the ring walk (≤ 1024 entries) plus serialization of up to `max` matched events. Larger `max` mostly costs serialization, not scan — the scan is the same ring walk regardless of `max`.
- A poll that matches nothing still advances the cursor to `latestSeq`, so a sparse subscriber pays the ring walk once, not repeatedly.

### 4.5 The overflow contract (B3)

The ring is a fixed `RING_CAPACITY = 1024`-entry buffer (`src/shared/events.ts`). When a client's cursor falls behind by more than the window, `poll()` reports it (`src/main/events/EventBus.ts`):

- `drifted = oldestSeq > 0 && cursor + 1 < oldestSeq` → `resync: true` and `droppedCount = oldestSeq − cursor − 1`.
- `ahead = cursor > latestSeq` (future cursor / daemon restart) → `resync: true`, no `droppedCount`.
- On resync the bus advances the effective cursor to `oldestSeq − 1` so the client gets the oldest still-live events, not an empty page.

Recovery is `pane.list` (PROTOCOL.md §2.5, §3): it returns `{ asOfSeq, bootId, panes }`; the client applies the snapshot and resumes `events.poll(cursor: asOfSeq)`. A `bootId` mismatch is the stricter signal (PROTOCOL.md §2.4) — the daemon restarted and the entire seq space is invalid, so all cached pane/pty ids and cursors must be dropped, not just the missed window.

B3's "first drop at backlog ≈ N" figure will be **less than a clean 1024** in practice: the ring already holds B1 + B2 traffic plus the daemon's own startup events (`process.started`, `pane.created`), so the 1024 window is partly consumed before B3 starts emitting. This is the honest "real ring-overflow point" issue #15 asked for — the usable backlog before drop is `1024 − (events already in the ring)`, not a fixed 1024.

---

## 5. Limitations and future work

- **One-pane harness.** B4 measures snapshot latency with a single metadata-bearing pane. The dominant snapshot cost is O(panes) (§4.3), so a multi-pane characterization (the bench is structured to take a pane count if the harness materializes more panes) would bound the worst case. The structural "no blocking" conclusion holds regardless; only the absolute latency grows.
- **Single-machine numbers.** All figures are environment-dependent — pipe IPC latency, CPU, and synchronous disk writes for `metadata.json` move them. The bench is reproducible; the numbers are not portable. Re-run on the target machine.
- **Sharded ring (future).** The ring is a single global 1024-entry buffer; a busy multi-workspace daemon shares it across all workspaces, so one noisy workspace can shorten everyone's backlog window. PROTOCOL.md §2.2 already reserves the right to evolve to a sharded/segmented ring without notice (opaque cursor). That would change B3's per-workspace overflow point but not the wire contract.
- **Native PID / faster persist (future).** Write latency includes a synchronous `metadata.json` persist. A future async-persist path (e.g. moving the write to a worker) would add a microtask boundary inside `set()` and require a per-pane lock to preserve the version contract (m0-design.md §3) — that is the one place the "single-threaded JS serializes everything" assumption is load-bearing, and the bench is the regression guard for it.
- **`system.capabilities` tier map is still planned.** Per `inventory.md`, the per-method stability tier is not yet reported by `system.capabilities`; this doc does not depend on it.
