# Build a substrate plugin

This is a single guided lesson. By the end you will have connected an external
program to a running wmux, watched real lifecycle events stream out of it,
written metadata back into a pane header, and walked the full plugin identity +
approval flow. You do not need to have read any wmux source.

**What you need:**

- Windows with PowerShell (the commands below are PowerShell; the plugin code is
  cross-platform Node ≥ 18).
- A wmux install. If you have one, skip step 1.
- A clone of this repo (for the reference plugin under `examples/event-recorder/`).

The plugin you will run is the **event recorder** — a small two-file program
that connects to wmux, polls the event bus, records each event as one JSON
line in an NDJSON file, and prints a one-line summary per event to the
console. It lives at
[`examples/event-recorder/`](../../examples/event-recorder/) with three
files: `recorder.mjs` (the loop), `wmux-rpc.mjs` (the connection client),
and `README.md`.

---

## 1. Install and run wmux

Install wmux (winget shown; Chocolatey and the GitHub release also work) and
launch it:

```powershell
winget install openwong2kim.wmux
```

Then start it from the Start menu, or from a terminal:

```powershell
wmux
```

You should see the wmux window with one workspace and one terminal pane. Leave
it open — everything below talks to this running instance.

> wmux writes its auth token to `~/.wmux-auth-token` and listens on the named
> pipe `\\.\pipe\wmux-<your-username>` as soon as it starts. The recorder finds
> both automatically.

---

## 2. Run the recorder once, and approve it

Open a **separate** PowerShell window (not a wmux pane — we want to prove an
external program can connect). Go to the repo and run the recorder in `--once`
mode:

```powershell
node examples/event-recorder/recorder.mjs --once
```

- The recorder introduces itself: it sends a `clientName`
  (`wmux-examples.event-recorder`) on every request, calls `mcp.identify`, and
  declares the capabilities it needs with `mcp.declarePermissions`. Step 6 walks
  through exactly what it declared. wmux refuses a request that carries no
  `clientName` at all (#1111), so there is no anonymous shortcut to take.
- `--once` polls once from the start of the ring (with a few bounded
  reconciliation hops if the ring already wrapped past the oldest event), prints
  what it finds, and exits.

Because wmux's production default is **enforce** mode, the first gated RPC the
recorder makes — `workspace.list`, to pick the workspace to watch — comes back
**rejected**, not with data:

```jsonc
{"ok":false,
 "error":"workspace.list: awaiting user approval (promptId=abc123)",
 "rejection":{"reason":"identity-status","status":"unconfirmed",
              "pendingApproval":{"promptId":"abc123"}}}
```

This is expected — the recorder prints
`workspace.list: waiting for approval in the wmux UI (promptId=...)`, detects
`pendingApproval`, and retries on a small backoff (the `withApprovalRetry`
idiom). Meanwhile, look at the **wmux window**: an approval dialog has appeared,
showing the plugin's name and the capabilities it declared.

**This step needs the GUI** — the approval prompt is a wmux UI surface. Click
**Approve**. The plugin's status moves to `trusted`, and the recorder's next
retry succeeds. The approval is remembered, so the later steps run without a
prompt.

> If you click **Deny**, the rejection's `status` flips to `denied` on the next
> retry and the recorder stops — the substrate will keep denying it. `denied`
> is sticky: re-running does **not** produce a new approval prompt. To
> re-grant, edit `~/.wmux/plugin-trust.json` (remove the plugin's entry or set
> its status back to `unconfirmed`) and re-run.

Once approved, the console shows one summary line per event already in the
ring — at minimum a `pane.created` and a `process.started` from when wmux
launched its first pane:

```text
[recorder 2026-06-10T05:00:01.123Z] seq=1 pane.created ws=ws-1 pane=p-1
[recorder 2026-06-10T05:00:01.456Z] seq=2 process.started ws=ws-1 pty=pty-1 pid=1234 shell=pwsh.exe
[recorder 2026-06-10T05:00:01.460Z] --once: recorded 2 events to ./events.ndjson
```

The full event objects land in `events.ndjson`, one JSON line each:

```powershell
Get-Content events.ndjson
```

```jsonc
{"seq":2,"ts":1749470000123,"workspaceId":"ws-1","type":"process.started","ptyId":"pty-1","shell":"pwsh.exe"}
```

Those are real events off the live bus. If you see them, your external program
is authenticated and reading the substrate.

> **If it prints nothing:** the ring may be empty if wmux just started and
> nothing has happened. Move on to step 3 — the live loop will show events as
> you create them.

---

## 3. Run it live

Now run without `--once` so it polls continuously:

```powershell
node examples/event-recorder/recorder.mjs
```

It prints any backlog, then waits. Each poll passes back the opaque
`nextCursor` from the previous poll, so you only ever see new events. Leave this
window running and visible.

---

## 4. Trigger an event by splitting a pane

Switch to the wmux window. Split the focused pane — press the wmux prefix then
the split key (default: `Ctrl+B` then `%` for a horizontal split or `"` for a
vertical split, or use the pane menu). A new terminal pane appears.

Switch back to the recorder window. You will see new summary lines appear (the
full JSON objects are appended to `events.ndjson` at the same time):

```text
[recorder ...] seq=7 pane.created ws=ws-1 pane=p-2
[recorder ...] seq=8 process.started ws=ws-1 pty=pty-2 pid=5678 shell=pwsh.exe
```

You just watched a UI action in wmux flow through the substrate to an external
program in real time. Note the two producers: `pane.created` comes from the
renderer, `process.started` from the main process — they can arrive in either
order (this is the cross-producer ordering caveat; use `ts` if order matters).

---

## 5. Write back: `--annotate`

So far the recorder only reads. Stop it (`Ctrl+C`) and restart in `--annotate`
mode:

```powershell
node examples/event-recorder/recorder.mjs --annotate
```

Now, every N recorded events (default 10, tunable with `--annotate-every`), the
recorder calls `pane.setMetadata` on the **pane it is watching** (the first pane
it saw). It writes a `label` onto that pane and records its own counters under
`custom.event-recorder.*`. Keep generating events — split a few panes, or just
wait while it polls — until it crosses the threshold.

Look at the **watched pane's header** in the wmux UI: it now shows the label the
recorder wrote. You wrote into the shared display vocabulary — the same `label`
field the wmux UI reads — from an external process. That is the round trip:
read events, write metadata, see it in the UI.

> The recorder writes with `mergeMode: 'merge'`, so it only sets `label` and its
> own `custom.event-recorder.*` keys; anything else on the pane is preserved.
> No new approval prompt appears: the capabilities you approved in step 2
> already include the two metadata writes.

---

## 6. What the identity handshake did

The approval you gave in step 2 is the part of this lesson a real plugin cannot
skip. Before its first gated call, the recorder:

1. Sends a `clientName` (`wmux-examples.event-recorder`) on every request.
2. Calls `mcp.identify({ name, version })` — registers as `unconfirmed`.
3. Calls `mcp.declarePermissions({ permissions: [...] })` declaring exactly the
   six capabilities it needs, each scoped to the method that requires it:
   - `events.subscribe` — gates `events.poll`.
   - `workspace.read` — gates `workspace.list`.
   - `pane.read` — gates `pane.list`.
   - `meta.read` — gates `pane.getMetadata` (read the current version before an
     optimistic-concurrency write).
   - `meta.write:label` — write the shared `label` field, which shows in the
     pane header.
   - `meta.write:custom.event-recorder.*` — write its own namespaced subtree.
4. Starts polling, wrapping each gated call in `withApprovalRetry` so a pending
   approval is waited out rather than treated as a failure.

Approving moved the plugin to `trusted` for exactly those six capabilities. A
later declaration that adds a capability drops it back to `unconfirmed` and
asks again, so the user always approves what the plugin can actually do.

The recorder still has a `--legacy` flag that skips all of this and sends no
`clientName`. It is kept only to show the refusal: wmux answers such a request
with `rejection.status = "legacy"` (#1111 closed the anonymous lane), and the
recorder stops with a message telling you to run it without `--legacy`.

## What you learned

- wmux is a **terminal substrate**: it owns panes, terminal I/O, and an event
  bus. You build workflow logic on top by connecting over its JSON-RPC socket.
- An **external program** authenticates with the token from `~/.wmux-auth-token`
  and connects to the per-user named pipe (no install hook, no plugin manager).
- The **event bus is pull-based**: `events.poll(cursor)` with an opaque cursor;
  there are eight event types including `agent.lifecycle`.
- **Metadata is the write surface**: `pane.setMetadata` writes shared display
  fields (`label`/`role`/`status`) and tool-private `custom.<tool>.*` subtrees,
  and the wmux UI reads them.
- **Identity + approval** is how an external program gets in at all: a request
  without a `clientName` is refused (#1111 closed the anonymous `legacy`
  lane), and enforce mode rejects an unconfirmed plugin with a
  `pendingApproval` promptId; you retry until the user approves in the UI.
