<sub>One prompt, three agents in three git worktrees — and the one question that came up, answered from a phone.</sub>

</div>

> **What's a *workspace multiplexer*?** tmux splits a terminal. wmux multiplexes whole **workspaces** — terminals, agents, git worktrees, a browser, and the channels they coordinate over — all owned by a daemon that keeps them running across quits, crashes, and full reboots.

## Install

**Windows** — a package manager skips the SmartScreen prompt:

```powershell
winget install openwong2kim.wmux    # or: choco install wmux
```

<sub>Offline? [Download Setup.exe](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/releases/latest). It is signed with a SignPath *test* certificate for now, so SmartScreen shows an unknown publisher ([why?](#install-help)).</sub>

**macOS** (Apple Silicon) — [download the .dmg](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/releases/latest) and drag wmux to Applications. It is Developer ID signed and notarized; on first launch the `wmux` CLI installs itself onto your PATH.

**iPhone** — [wmux for iOS on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/wmux-workspace-for-ai-agents/id6797904556) (free). It pairs with the daemon on your Mac: start `wmux web` over HTTPS (the sidebar **Remote** button has a one-click Tailscale option) and scan the QR code it shows.

**Linux** — experimental AppImage / .deb / .rpm builds are on the [releases page](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/releases/latest).

<sub>Windows x64 and macOS arm64 update themselves: wmux checks for a release every 30 minutes and verifies it against a published SHA-256 before installing.</sub>

## Features

### Answer your agents from your phone

When an agent stops to ask you something — a Claude Code `AskUserQuestion` prompt, or a tool call held by a wmux approval gate — the question lands on your iPhone's lock screen as a push notification. Pick the answer in the Inbox (an option, **Approve**, or **Deny**) and the pane on your desktop advances. Terminals and agent output go straight from your Mac to your phone, against the daemon you run; notification content reaches the push relay only as a sealed envelope it cannot read. The one exception is the lock-screen Live Activity: it carries six plain counts (pending approvals, running / working / idle agents, blocked panes, longest wait), and when it starts, your Mac's hostname — no pane names or question text. See [the phone client contract](docs/phone-client-contract.md).

<img alt="An agent stops to ask a question; it lands in the iPhone Inbox, the answer is picked there, and the desktop pane moves on" src="docs/readme/phone.gif" width="900" />

### One prompt, N worktrees

Fan one prompt out into up to 8 tasks, each in its own git worktree on a fresh `wtask/*` branch, with its own agent pane and a private mission channel. Review the diffs side by side, tick the hunks you want across files, and adopt them as one all-or-nothing `git apply` — your tree takes the whole selection or stays untouched. Then close the task or open a pull request in one click.

<img alt="Two worktree tasks from one prompt; hunks ticked across files in the diff review, adopted into the working tree, then the task is closed" src="docs/readme/worktrees.gif" width="900" />

### Two ways to browse

Your agents drive the browser through wmux's MCP tools — navigate, click, type, snapshot, screenshot, stateful `browser_repl` sessions, and `browser_replay` for recorded flows — and you watch every page they touch. Both backends below get the full automation toolset; pick one in Settings → Browser. (A third, *External*, only opens and navigates tabs in your default browser.)

**Built-in browser panes.** An embedded browser pane opens as a split in the agent's workspace, and each agent gets its own — no agent drives another agent's pane.

<img alt="Two agents each open their own built-in browser pane beside their terminal and browse at the same time" src="docs/readme/browser-builtin.gif" width="900" />

**A real Chrome over CDP.** Choose *Chrome (dedicated agent browser)* and your agents drive a real Chrome over CDP instead, each in its own tab. It keeps its own persistent profile — sign in once and the logins stick — separate from your daily browser, and each workspace can bind its own Chrome profile.

<img alt="Two agents drive their own tabs in a dedicated Chrome over CDP" src="docs/readme/browser-chrome.gif" width="900" />

### Claude Code and Codex, talking

Agents in different panes message each other through wmux, whichever CLI they run. Here Claude Code changes a function and asks the Codex pane next to it for a review with `send_message`; Codex reads the file and sends its review back the same way, and Claude adds the test Codex suggested. A busy agent gets a one-line notice naming the sender and reads the full message with `a2a_task_query`.

<img alt="Claude Code asks Codex in the next pane for a review over wmux, Codex sends its review back, and Claude adds the suggested test" src="docs/readme/a2a.gif" width="900" />

### Agents that coordinate

An orchestrator hands a task to an idle pane and relays the answer back. An execute approval gate stops any agent from running code in your workspace without your OK.

<img alt="The orchestrator picks the idle pane, the task lands there, the worker edits and tests, and the answer comes back to the orchestrator" src="docs/readme/orchestrator.gif" width="900" />

Channels are durable rooms your agents read, post, and get @-mentioned into, each message with a server-verified sender.

<img alt="A channel an agent posted to, with the agent's verified sender chip on its message" src="docs/readme/channels.gif" width="900" />

### Fleet View

`Cmd+Shift+A` (`Ctrl+Shift+A` on Windows and Linux) shows every agent across every workspace in one panel, blocked ones first, with one inbox for every pending approval. From a local agent's row you can jump to its pane, message it, stash it, label it, or close it; remote rows jump.

<img alt="Fleet lists three agents across three workspaces with the blocked one on top; an approval is handled from the inbox and the blocked agent is answered" src="docs/readme/fleet.gif" width="900" />

### Survives quit, crash, and reboot

A standalone daemon owns every PTY, so closing the app leaves your sessions running — processes and all.

<img alt="wmux quits while an agent and a counter are running; after reopening, the counter kept counting and the agent finished its turn" src="docs/readme/survive-quit.gif" width="900" />

After a crash or a full OS reboot, a recovered pane offers **Resume**. Click it to type the agent command back in; for Claude Code, a second click adds the exact session's `--resume <id>` when wmux knows which session the pane held (otherwise it falls back to the most recent one). Press Enter and you are back in the conversation. Panes declared in `wmux.json` are supervised and restarted automatically.

## More

- **78 MCP tools, zero config** — browser, terminal, panes, channels, A2A, fan-out, and orchestrator tools register themselves in three load-out profiles (`full`, `core`, `commander`); or script the `wmux` CLI (`send`, `read-screen`, `list-panes`, `channel post`).
- **Prompt schedules** — queue an exact prompt for one agent session (**+1h / +5h / +24h**, one-shot or repeating); it waits for the session to be idle before it delivers ([details](docs/how-to/session-prompt-scheduling.md)).
- **One-click loops** — put the orchestrator on an objective with per-iteration steps and a done-when checklist; it keeps working across restarts.
- **`wmux web`** — your live panes in any phone browser (PWA-installable), read-only and loopback-only by default.
- **Notifications** — desktop toasts when an agent finishes, flags on `rm -rf` / `git push --force` / `DROP TABLE`, and optional webhook or ntfy pings from the daemon.
- **Themes & locales** — 9 built-in UI themes plus a custom theme, 11 terminal palettes (light ones included), and 23 locales scaffolded (English, Polish, Chinese, and Korean are the most complete) — [translations welcome](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/labels/good%20first%20issue).
- **Plugins** — sandboxed iframe plugins with an explicit permission model.
- **Security** — token-authed IPC, SSRF guard, PTY input sanitization, randomized CDP port, Electron Fuses.

<summary><b>Full feature list</b></summary>

- **Terminal** — xterm.js + WebGL, native PTY (ConPTY on Windows, forkpty on macOS), Unicode 11 width tables (correct CJK / emoji), split panes, tabs, floating pane, smart right-click (selection→copy / empty→paste / link menu), scroll bookmarks, Vi copy mode, regex search, configurable scrollback (up to 100K lines) with disk persistence, shell integration (OSC 133) for semantic command boundaries (Constrained Language Mode safe).
- **Keybindings** — `Ctrl+B` prefix mode with a default action set, fully customizable, reset-to-defaults.
- **Workspaces** — drag-and-drop sidebar, `Ctrl+1~9` quick switch, multiview (several workspaces side by side), layout templates, full session persistence (layout / tabs / cwd / scrollback), Fleet View cockpit.
- **Git surface** — a Git page on the rail for the repo behind your active pane (or all your repos): worktrees (create / open as a workspace / remove, never force-deleted) plus pull requests and comments (GitHub via `gh`, GitLab via `glab`, self-hosted included). A read-only workspace diff is one palette command away, and from any hunk you can ask the orchestrator with the code attached.
- **Browser + CDP** — built-in panel (`Ctrl+Shift+L`), nav bar / DevTools / back-forward, element Inspector (hover-highlight, click-to-copy LLM context), full automation: click / fill / type / screenshot / JS eval / key press. Works with React inputs and CJK text. `browser_repl` keeps a stateful page session across calls, `browser_replay` re-runs a recorded flow, and `browser_smart_snapshot` / `browser_snapshot q=` cut a large page down to the question asked.
- **Notifications** — output-throughput activity detection (not pattern matching, works with any agent), native OS toasts + taskbar flash (Windows) / Dock & menu-bar tray (macOS), process-exit alerts, notification panel (`Ctrl+I`), Web Audio cues. Point `notifySinks` in `~/.wmux/config.json` at a webhook or ntfy topic and the daemon pings it when an agent asks for approval or finishes a turn — outbound only, off unless configured.
- **Agent detection** — any CLI agent runs in a pane (each pane is a plain PTY; nothing depends on detection). Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot CLI additionally get first-class detection: start → activates monitoring, warns on critical actions.
- **Per-session prompt schedules** — from a detected agent pane, queue an exact prompt for a local future time or use the +1h / +5h / +24h shortcuts; one-shot and repeating schedules persist across app restarts. Delivery is bound to the original PTY, its daemon-minted non-reusable incarnation, and the detected agent family; it waits while a turn, an approval, or active typing is in progress and uses safe bracketed paste before submit. A replaced session is paused visibly instead of being retargeted.
- **Loops** — put the orchestrator on an objective with optional per-iteration steps (a `/`-picker autocompletes your `.claude` skills), a done-when checklist, and a cadence. It is event-woken by your agents, survives restarts, states up front what it may and may not do, and stopping fails closed to report-only.
- **Task journey (fan-out → diff → PR)** — spawn up to 8 `WorkTask` missions from one prompt, each with a dedicated git worktree on a fresh `wtask/*` branch, its own task workspace, a private mission channel, and a file-backed initial prompt. Idempotency-keyed end to end; per-task failures compensate individually, and worktrees are never force-deleted. Harvest through a diff surface (file tree, unified diff, per-hunk checkboxes across files in any text file — renames, binaries, mode-only and over-cap files stay display-only). The selected hunks are combined into a single all-or-nothing `git apply` gated by a target snapshot; it is refused as a whole if the target moved, has uncommitted changes to those files, or any selected hunk no longer applies. The selection is resolved against a fresh read of the task worktree at adopt time, so re-read the diff if the agent is still writing. Comment straight into the mission channel, then close the task (the worktree is removed only after a clean check — dirty output is preserved and the close is held) or open a PR with one click (`gh`-gated, idempotent re-entry). A palette cleanup list scans the worktree root for leftovers.
- **Multi-agent (A2A)** — agent-to-agent messaging + task delegation addressed by pane/surface, same-workspace and cross-workspace. Per-pane **execute approval gate** (a remote agent can't spawn a `bypassPermissions` worker in your workspace without your approval). Symmetric reply (a reply returns to the exact pane that asked), pollable task inbox on the EventBus, broadcast, and a unified approval inbox in Fleet View.
- **Channels** — rooms for a workspace's agents: create / join / invite / post / read / archive, each message carrying a server-verified sender shown as the sender's pane identity chip plus a per-workspace color badge. A durable per-member inbox (unread + @-mention counts, survives reboot), a human-readable right-side dock, operator self-join for private agent rooms (audited), and a headless `wmux channel` CLI (`unread` / `read` / `post` / `ack` / `join` / `list`) so a nudged agent can catch up and reply.
- **Supervision & wmux.json** — declare panes/agents in a trust-gated `wmux.json` (auto-layout + custom commands). The daemon supervises declared agent panes like an init system: restart policy with backoff across process exits, daemon restarts, and full reboots, with a runaway-crash guard — and it resumes the exact agent conversation on restart, not a fresh shell.
- **Plugins** — sandboxed iframe plugin host with a bridge + explicit permission model and pane decorations.
- **Daemon** — background session management (survives app restart), scrollback dump + auto-recovery, start-at-login registration on Windows and macOS (relaunches after reboot), dead-session TTL reaping.
- **MCP tools** — `browser_*` (open / navigate / screenshot / snapshot / click / fill / type / evaluate / press_key and more), `terminal_read` / `terminal_read_events` (OSC 133) / `terminal_send` / `terminal_send_key`, `workspace_list` / `surface_list` / `surface_new` / `pane_list` / `pane_split` / `pane_close` / `pane_focus`, `channel_*`, `a2a_*` + `send_message` for agent-to-agent delegation, `fanout_start` / `ledger_update` / `deck_*` orchestration, `repl_*` scripting, `wmux_events_poll` / `wmux_search_panes`. 78 tools in the `full` profile, with slimmer `core` and `commander` load-outs, scoped to the workspace that called them. Every browser tool takes a `surfaceId` so each session drives its own browser.

<summary><b>FAQ + install troubleshooting</b></summary>

- **Is wmux a tmux port?** No — tmux was the inspiration, not the base. wmux is a native **workspace multiplexer** on Electron (ConPTY on Windows, forkpty on macOS): tmux-*style* split panes, prefix keys, and session persistence, but it also multiplexes agents, git worktrees, a browser, and channels. No WSL / Cygwin / MSYS2.
- **Which Macs are supported?** Apple Silicon (arm64) — download the `.dmg` from [releases](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/releases/latest). It is Developer ID signed, notarized and stapled, so Gatekeeper lets it through on first launch. Intel builds aren't produced right now; open an issue if you need one.
- **Can I reach my panes from my phone?** Two ways. The native [wmux for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/wmux-workspace-for-ai-agents/id6797904556) app (free, iPhone) pairs with your Mac's daemon and pushes agent approvals to the lock screen — answer there and the pane advances. Or skip the app: `wmux web` serves your live panes to any browser (PWA-installable). It is **read-only and loopback-only by default**; `--allow-input` and network exposure are explicit opt-ins. For HTTPS, use the one-command `wmux web --tailscale` path, or terminate it directly with `wmux web --expose --tls-cert <fullchain.pem> --tls-key <privkey.pem>` (add `--allow-host <certificate-dns-name>` so requests for that name are accepted and it is advertised in URLs). Re-running `wmux web` on a running server keeps every option you do not pass (port, `--expose`/`--host`/`--tailscale`, `--allow-host`, TLS, and each `--allow-*` grant); turn one off explicitly with `--no-allow-<x>`, `--loopback`, `--no-tls`, or `--stop`. The phone Chat view needs **Conversation access** (`--allow-transcript`), which — like photo & file upload and the Advanced dangerous-launch option — is also a toggle in the desktop's Remote popover. Bare `--expose` remains HTTP and prints an explicit cleartext warning. Even read-only shows a pane's full scrollback to whoever can reach the port, so do not publish it to the open internet. You can also attach a remote machine's `wmux web` into your own desktop app's sidebar and mirror its panes locally — see [Attach a remote machine's workspaces](docs/how-to/remote-workspaces.md).
- **Works with Claude Code / Codex / Gemini?** Yes. wmux auto-detects them and registers an MCP server so they can drive the browser and read terminal output.
- **Multiple agents at once?** Yes. Each pane is an independent PTY, and agents coordinate over A2A MCP tools — message each other, delegate tasks by pane, reply to the exact pane that asked, and gate any cross-agent code execution behind your approval.
- **Feels heavy, or a workspace switch is slow?** See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) — what runs while a pane is hidden, the daemon's `config.json` knobs, and how to self-diagnose with `wmux doctor`.
- **"Windows protected your PC" warning?** The release pipeline already signs `Setup.exe` through [SignPath](https://signpath.io/), but with a *test* certificate while the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) OSS certificate is pending — Windows does not trust it, so SmartScreen still reports an unknown publisher. It's safe: click **More info → Run anyway**, or install via **winget** / **Chocolatey** to skip the prompt.
- **Installing or updating by hand with Setup.exe?** First shut wmux down completely: right-click the tray icon → **Shut down wmux (close all sessions)**. Plain *Quit* keeps the session daemon running, and Setup.exe cannot replace a running wmux. It fails with "Failed to remove existing directory" and leaves the install broken. If that already happened, wait a few seconds for wmux to exit, then run Setup.exe again. The in-app updater handles all of this for you.
- **Installer blocked with no "Run anyway"?** **Smart App Control (SAC)** on Windows 11 can block unsigned binaries outright. Check with `Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object SmartAppControlState`. SAC uses cloud reputation, so blocks are often transient — retry later, use winget/choco, or build from source ([#200](https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux/issues/200)).

**PowerShell one-liner** (downloads the prebuilt Setup.exe, verifies SHA-256, no build tools):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwong2kim/wmux/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

</details>

## Build from source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/openwong2kim/wmux.git
cd wmux
npm install
npm start          # dev mode
npm run make       # build installer
```

Requires Node 18+ and Python 3.x, plus a native toolchain: VS Build Tools (C++ workload) on Windows — `WMUX_FROM_SOURCE=1 irm …/install.ps1 | iex` auto-installs them — or the Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS (`xcode-select --install`).
