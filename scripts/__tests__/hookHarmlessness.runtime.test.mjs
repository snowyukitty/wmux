// P-5 — the A/B harmlessness gate, wired into CI.
//
// wmux installs hooks into other people's agents. #898 is what it costs when
// one of them says something the host reads as an instruction: the permission
// gate emitted `ask` on every "wmux has no opinion" path, `ask` is not
// neutral, and a bypassPermissions session started asking permission to run
// `Read` — with the documented escape hatch emitting `ask` too. The claim this
// file defends is narrow and testable:
//
//   installing a wmux hook is indistinguishable, to the host, from installing
//   a hook that provably has no opinion.
//
// Every case runs a CONTROL (a no-op hook) and a TREATMENT (the real hook,
// invoked the way the integration's own manifest invokes it) and compares what
// the host would observe. The measurement lives in
// scripts/lib/hookHarmlessness.mjs; the pass criteria live here, except the
// rule for re-measuring a latency-only failure (settleLatency, in the lib).
//
// Two properties keep this from decaying into a green no-op:
//   - the matrix is DERIVED from hooks.json, so a hook added to a manifest is
//     covered the moment it is added;
//   - the gate is re-proven against the real bridge on every run, by putting
//     #898 back into a copy of it and requiring rejection.
// The second one is not theoretical: the first draft of this harness passed a
// bridge with #898 reintroduced, because its sandbox had no auth token and
// every bridge bailed before reaching the decision path at all.
