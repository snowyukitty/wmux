// P-5 — the A/B harmlessness gate for wmux's agent hooks.
//
// wmux installs observation hooks into other people's agents. #898 is what
// happens when one of those hooks says something the host reads as an
// instruction: the Claude Code permission gate emitted `ask` on every
// "wmux has no opinion" path, and `ask` is not neutral — it forces a prompt
// and overrides the session's permission mode. A bypassPermissions session
// started asking for permission to run `Read`, and the documented escape
// hatch (`WMUX_GATE=0`) emitted `ask` too, so there was no way to turn it off.
//
// "Observation hooks are harmless" is a claim, not a fact. This harness
// MEASURES it. The claim being tested is precise:
//
//   Installing a wmux hook must be indistinguishable, to the host, from
//   installing a hook that provably has no opinion.
//
// So every case runs twice — a CONTROL (a no-op hook: drain stdin, exit 0,
// write nothing) and a TREATMENT (the real wmux hook, invoked byte-for-byte
// the way the host's own manifest invokes it) — and the two are compared.
//
// The three pass criteria from the plan (§6), and how each is measured here:
//
//   1. Approval/denial set identical.
//      The host's decision is a pure function of (exit code, stdout). Each
//      host's contract is pinned in HOST_CONTRACTS below with its source, and
//      classifyDecision() applies it. Control and treatment must classify the
//      same. For an observation hook that means `none` — and stdout must be
//      byte-empty, which is the direct #898 regression pin.
//
//   2. Completion and duration.
//      In a live A/B this is the agent's task duration (±50%). Here the host
//      is simulated, so the equivalent — and the thing that actually reaches
//      the agent — is the hook's own wall clock. A hook that hangs blows the
//      budget; a hook that never completes is caught by the same timeout.
//      The ±50% band is not applicable against a no-op baseline (a no-op is
//      pure node startup), so this layer asserts an ABSOLUTE per-hook budget
//      instead. The ±50% comparison lives in the live layer.
//
//   3. Hook process lifetime.
//      Measured without walking the process tree: the host holds the hook's
//      stdout/stderr pipes and waits on them. If any descendant outlives the
//      hook while holding those pipes, 'close' fires later than 'exit' — or
//      never. So closeMs - exitMs is the survivor signal, and it is exactly
//      the survivor that would matter to the host. stdin drain is measured by
//      writing a payload larger than the bridge's own cap and requiring the
//      write to settle (ok or EPIPE) rather than deadlock.
//
// Deliberately NOT tested here: whether the signal actually reached wmux.
// This harness runs with no daemon reachable on purpose — "wmux is not
// running" is the single most common state a plugin user is in, and it is the
// state #898 broke. Delivery is covered by the integration's own tests.
