// v6: zsh stub에 OSC 7(cwd) 방출 추가 — mac 기본 zsh가 cd를 보고하지 않아
// 사이드바 브랜치/git 컨텍스트가 생성 시점 cwd에 고정되던 문제 수정
// (owner-reported 2026-07-19).
// v7: 번호만 재승격 — 릴리즈 데몬이 OSC 7 없는 스크립트를 ".version=6"으로
// 이미 설치해 둔 기기에서 v6 게이트가 "최신"으로 오판, OSC 7 스텁이 영영
// 설치되지 않던 문제(dogfood 실측 2026-07-20). 내용 변경 없음.
// v8: emit OSC 7 (cwd) from the pwsh and bash integrations too (issue #540).
// The daemon's OSC 7-sticky permanently disables prompt scraping on the first
// OSC 7 it sees, on the assumption that "the integration hook re-emits OSC 7
// on every prompt" — which v6 made true only for zsh. On pwsh/bash a single
// stray OSC 7 from any child program (agent TUI, nested shell) killed the only
// cwd source, freezing the pane's tracked cwd at its spawn value (usually
// home) — so splits landed in home, regressing #515.
// v9: percent-encode the zsh OSC 7 payload — parity with the v8 pwsh/bash
// encoders (#541 review follow-up). The v6 zsh hook emitted raw $PWD, but the
// daemon's parseOsc7Cwd unconditionally decodeURIComponent()s the payload, so
// a directory whose real name contains a literal percent sequence
// ("build%20cache") was silently corrupted, and a raw ESC/BEL byte in a
// directory name could terminate the OSC 7 early and inject terminal escapes.
// v10: hand the $? snapshot to the wrapped prompt (issue #1267). The wrapper
// snapshots $? and $LASTEXITCODE as its first two statements, but never gave
// that snapshot to the prompt it wraps — and every statement in between resets
// $? to true. So oh-my-posh, Starship, and anything else that reads $? to
// colour an exit-code segment saw "success" after every failed command, while
// the same config in Windows Terminal was correct.
// v11: decide the exit code from whether $LASTEXITCODE MOVED (issue #1270). It
// is set only by native commands and never cleared, so preferring it whenever
// it was non-null meant that from a session's first native command onward every
// failing cmdlet reported D;0 — the value agent.lifecycle.exitCode is built
// from. Preferring $? instead trades the bug for its mirror image, marking a
// successful cmdlet failed with the previous native command's code. Movement
// since the last prompt is what separates "this number describes the command
// that just ran" from "this number is left over".
// v12: a `codex` shell function in the bash and zsh integrations. Codex CLI
// 0.157+ starts one shared per-account background server the first time a
// TUI runs, and that server outlives the pane that started it and parents
// the shell commands and MCP servers of every later Codex thread on the
// account. Typed in a pane, it inherited that pane's WMUX_* keys, so other
// panes' Codex commands acted as the first pane. See CODEX_SEED_GUARD.
const INTEGRATION_VERSION = 12;

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Codex shared-server seed guard (v12) — shared by the bash and zsh scripts.
//
// Measured against codex-cli 0.157.1 with a fresh CODEX_HOME and no server
// running:
//   - `codex`, `codex resume --last`, `codex agents` → start a managed server
//     (ppid 1) that carries every WMUX_* key of the shell that typed it.
//   - `--no-daemon` (before or after `resume`) → no server, no control socket.
//   - `-c features.daemon_auto_start=false` → interactive forms and `exec`
//     run in-process instead, with no error; `agents` still starts a server,
//     and an explicit `app-server daemon start` still works.
//   - `exec`/`e`/`review` → run in-process; no server started, and none
//     connected to when one was already running.
//
// Classifying the command line is best effort, so no classification is
// trusted to keep the pane identity on its own:
//   - every wrapped call gets `-c features.daemon_auto_start=false` when the
//     installed codex knows that feature — a misread line still cannot start
//     the server from this shell;
//   - any word naming a server (`app-server`, `exec-server`, `remote-control`,
//     `daemon`), anywhere on the line, runs the call with every WMUX_* key
//     removed. A false positive only drops the pane identity for that run;
//   - interactive forms (no subcommand, a prompt, `resume`, `fork`, any
//     `-i/--image`, which only the interactive CLI takes) also get
//     `--no-daemon` and keep the pane env — the thread runs in this process,
//     so its commands act as this pane and nothing outlives it. Without the
//     feature guard or `--no-daemon` they run with WMUX_* removed;
//   - `exec`/`e`/`review` keep the pane env: the hooks bridge needs
//     WMUX_PTY_ID to attribute their events to this pane;
//   - an option this function does not know, before the first word, means the
//     subcommand cannot be told apart from an option value: identity is kept
//     only when the feature guard is available (plus `--no-daemon`), otherwise
//     WMUX_* is removed;
//   - every other subcommand (`agents`, `queue`, `app`, `login`, …) runs with
//     WMUX_* removed.
// It steps aside entirely when the command already chooses a server
// (`--remote`, `--no-daemon` — wmux's own Codex launches pass `--remote`),
// when WMUX_CODEX_WRAP=0, or when no codex executable is on PATH.
//
// What the installed codex supports is probed once per binary (keyed by its
// path, inode and mtime) with `--help` and `features list`, both run with
// WMUX_* removed. The binary is always called by absolute path: zsh
// alias-expands the word after `command`, and the user's rc is sourced before
// this function is defined. On WSL the pane PATH starts with wmux's own codex
// shim, which finds the real codex by skipping WMUX_WSL_BIN; calls that remove
// WMUX_* therefore go to the real codex directly (through the shim they would
// find the shim again and re-exec forever).
//
// Not covered (the codex CLI is reached without this function): scripts and
// `bash -c`/`zsh -c` lines, `env codex`, `exec codex`, a full path to the
// binary, a user alias for codex that expands to anything but `codex …`
// (aliases win over functions), a shell started inside the pane (nested
// zsh/bash, tmux, screen — they read the user's rc, not this one), a
// user-defined `codex` function (left alone on purpose), Git Bash, shells with
// the integration turned off, fish/pwsh, and shells opened before v12 was
// installed.
