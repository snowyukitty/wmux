// TranscriptProjector — the daemon's read-only projection of a pane's Claude
// Code transcript into `TurnEvent`s, plus the push side that tells subscribed
// clients when there is more.
//
// Why the daemon owns this: the transcript path is only known from the resume
// binding the hook pipeline persists (`meta.resumeBinding.transcriptPath`), the
// daemon is the always-on process (so the projection survives a GUI close), and
// the phone surface (`WebTerminalServer`) can then call these same methods
// in-process instead of a second normalizer being written for it.
//
// Two independent triggers, both load-bearing:
//   1. hook nudges — `HookIngest` calls `nudge()` on every resolved signal.
//      Free, and the only trigger that knows a turn ENDED.
//   2. fs.watch — if the Claude plugin is not installed there are no nudges at
//      all, so the watch is the floor, not a nicety.
//
// Three hard rules, each from a specific failure this code would otherwise
// cause:
//   - A3, byte budget. `DaemonClient` drops its ENTIRE control buffer past 1MB,
//     so one oversized append would destroy an unrelated `session.died` on the
//     same socket. Every payload is fitted under BUDGET_BYTES by reading LESS,
//     never by shipping more; the remainder arrives on the next read.
//   - A4, watch the DIRECTORY. `gitContextWatch.ts` documents that file-watching
//     goes silent after an atomic rename with no error event to re-arm on, and
//     a transcript is rewritten that way. Match on basename, `persistent:false`,
//     unref'd debounce, and a polling fallback for the setups where fs.watch
//     cannot arm at all (network home dirs).
//   - A6, unicast. Subscriptions are keyed by (clientId, sessionId) and dropped
//     when the socket closes, so a renderer reload cannot leak watchers and a
//     non-subscriber never receives conversation content.
