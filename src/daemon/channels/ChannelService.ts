// ─── ChannelService ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Daemon-side channel state owner. The ONLY writer to ChannelState — every
// mutation funnels through this service so the per-channel mutex, idempotency
// LRU, and `saveImmediate` PERSIST_FAILED surfacing stay in one place.
//
// The service holds:
//   - `state: ChannelState` — in-memory mirror, loaded from the writer at
//     construction and re-saved on every mutation. The writer is the
//     persistence model; this service is the in-memory authoritative copy
//     for the lifetime of the daemon.
//   - `mutexes: Map<channelId, Promise<void>>` — per-channel promise chain.
//     Each mutation for a given channelId waits for the previous one to
//     finish. Channels don't contend with each other (different keys).
//   - `idempotency: Map<channelId, Map<clientMsgId, {seq, lastUsedAt}>>` —
//     LRU cache of recent clientMsgIds, capped at CHANNEL_IDEMPOTENCY_CAP
//     per channel. Lookups in the post path are O(1) amortized; eviction
//     is O(n) only on overflow.
//
// Plan reference: U3 (a2a-channels service layer).

   * Scoped on both axes, because a nudge's evidence is narrow: it concerns ONE
   * member row (a sibling member of the same workspace has its own pane and its
   * own cursor) and only the seq range the nudge announced (the member had
   * already read everything at or below its cursor; anything past the head was
   * posted afterwards). Matching on workspace alone flipped every pending row
   * in the channel, and since `ack` used to promote only `pending`, nothing
   * ever recovered.
   *
   * A SUCCESS is deliberately NOT recorded. The hint reaching a pane is not the
   * agent having received the message — only the ack path (read === received)
   * may write `delivered` — so a success has nothing durable to say, and
   * writing one would append to the event log on every wake tick.
   *
   * Runs under the channel lock and through the same commit/apply path as every
   * other mutation, so a replay from the event log reconstructs it.
