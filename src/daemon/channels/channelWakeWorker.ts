// ─── Channels v2 Step 3a: the wake worker ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The push half of the durable inbox. Delivery correctness lives in the
// PULL path (cursor + unread — a message is never lost by a missed nudge);
// this worker only shortens the time until an agent LOOKS. It injects a
// one-line hint into an idle member pane's PTY:
//
//   [wmux] #general: 2 unread (1 mention you) — run: wmux channel read ch-… --since 5
//
// Wake strategy stack (design doc):
//   - ATTACHED Claude panes are SKIPPED here — the renderer's Stop-hook
//     mention path owns them (surfaceAgent busy check, proven in
//     production). A DETACHED Claude pane has no renderer and therefore no
//     Stop-hook path — headless (the reboot-recovery window) it is a valid
//     injection target like any other agent (Codex round-3: a Claude-only
//     workspace used to stay silent forever in headless, never even
//     reaching the exhaustion handoff because no nudge was ever spent).
//   - Generic panes (Codex/OpenCode/…) get the PTY injection below.
//   - Agents that poll (`wmux channel unread` in AGENTS.md) need no nudge
//     at all — the worker is an accelerator, never a dependency.
//
// Safety rules (all live-dogfood findings, 2026-07-02):
//   F2  — text and Enter are written SEPARATELY (a single "text\r" write
//         trips TUI bracketed-paste heuristics and strands the nudge in the
//         composer, uncommitted).
//   Quiet gate — inject only after QUIET_MS of output silence (a busy agent
//         mid-stream must never get bytes spliced into its input; input
//         activity echoes as output for both shells and TUIs, so output
//         quiet is the conservative proxy for both).
//   Target discipline — a stable principal coordinate must resolve to that
//         exact live agent pane or no injection occurs. Legacy rows without a
//         usable principal lookup use the slug/only-live-agent heuristic.
//         Ambiguity or an invalid exact target = polling fallback, never a
//         guess.
//   Re-nudge policy — mention-unread re-nudges with backoff up to a hard
//         cap, then STOPS and emits `channel.nudgeExhausted` (loop-storm
//         guard: two agents must not ping-pong each other's token budgets
//         forever). Plain unread nudges ONCE per head advance. Ack resets
//         everything (cursor catches up → unread 0 → tracker cleared).
//
// State is deliberately IN-MEMORY (nudge attempts are retry bookkeeping,
// not truth — the deliveryStatus dead-code audit finding is not coming
// back as a schema field).
