   *

   * was pressed: the shell prints its prompt once, before the renderer

   * never sends, and a changed one sends while still muted.

   * Windows, when the geometry changed at ANY resize inside the window (not
   * just the first — the renderer's first fit is often transient, and the
   * Resume row shrinks the pane): the held bytes may mix ConPTY frames from
   * more than one size, so none are replayed. Instead the PTY is resized to
   * its current geometry once the unmute is in place. ConPTY owns the screen
   * and answers every resize call, same size included, with a complete
   * repaint at that geometry (CSI H, every row, the cursor), measured 1–15 ms
   * after the call. That frame goes out live, so the prompt reaches the pane
   * whatever the timing of the renderer's resizes. Discarding without it left
   * the pane blank whenever the last repaint landed before this timer fired
   * (4 of 6 panes in the Windows dogfood of #1469).
