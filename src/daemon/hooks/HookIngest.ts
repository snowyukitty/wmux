// HookIngest — daemon-side ingestion of `AgentSignal` envelopes (M1).
//
// The hook bridge (`integrations/<agent>/bin/wmux-bridge.mjs`) used to reach
// the Electron MAIN pipe only, and fast-dropped on ENOENT — so with the GUI
// closed there was no hook authority anywhere. The daemon is the always-on
// process AND already runs the AgentDetector (`DaemonPTYBridge`), so moving
// ingest here makes hook-vs-detector dedup LOCAL to one process instead of a
// cross-process race, and gives phone-facing surfaces a hook-authoritative
// signal with no GUI running.
//
// ASCII flow:
//
//   Claude Code Stop event
//      │
//      ▼
//   integrations/claude/bin/wmux-bridge.mjs
//      │ reads ~/.wmux/daemon-auth-token, opens the DAEMON pipe
//      │ sends RPC: daemon.hooks.signal { kind, agent, cwd, ts, payload, ... }
//      ▼
//   DaemonPipeServer auth → ok
//      │
//      ▼
//   daemon.hooks.signal (src/daemon/index.ts) → HookIngest.handle
//      │ 1. isAgentSignal(params) validate

 * Arbitration outcome the daemon attaches to every `agent.event` it
 * broadcasts, hook- and detector-sourced alike.
 *
 * The daemon is now the ONLY place hook-vs-detector dedup happens, so main
 * must not re-run its own — it reads this instead (see the daemon.hooks.signal
 * contract, decision 4). Three outcomes, matching what main's
 * DaemonNotificationRouter used to compute for itself:
 *   - 'emit'  → fan out the notification AND the `agent.lifecycle` tee
 *   - 'dedup' → the other source already covered this turn: lifecycle tee with
 *               `decision:'dedup'`, NO notification
 *   - 'veto'  → detector-only, hook-governed pane: identity metadata only,
 *               no notification and no lifecycle tee (the hook is canonical
 *               here and the detector's always-visible footer would both
 *               re-fire mid-turn and poison the ledger against the real Stop).
 *               #935: main also withholds the lifecycle STATUS on a veto —
 *               that footer is what put a false 'waiting' on the roster row
 *               and into "N need you". 'internal' does NOT share this (the
 *               alarm's own judgement leaves the status live), so the two
 *               verdicts are no longer interchangeable main-side.
 *               `agent.awaiting_input` is never stamped 'veto' here, and main
 *               enforces that locally too rather than trusting this process.
 *
 * `decision` is absent for DETECTOR statuses that are not emit-class (e.g.
 * 'running'): those never participated in dedup on either side.
 *
 * 'activity' is the hook-only fourth value (A2/A3) and names a CLASS, not one
 * kind: metadata-only. No toast, no lifecycle tee, no dedup ledger — the pane's
 * state changed, nobody is waiting on it. Consumers dispatch on `hookKind` to
 * decide what it means:
 *   - 'agent.activity'      → PostToolUse; feeds the Fleet "running: <tool>" line
 *   - 'agent.session_start' → a fresh session on this pane; CLEARS the previous
 *                             session's stale activity / pendingQuestion labels
 * Treat an unrecognized `hookKind` in this class as a no-op rather than an
 * error: the class is deliberately open so a new metadata kind does not need a
 * new event type.
 *
 * Two verdict-gate values (CompletionAlarm) join the union:
 *   - 'pending' — a provisional completion window is OPEN. The daemon does NOT
 *                 broadcast yet; the stash's resume closure fires the ledger
 *                 write + broadcast at confirmation. This value never leaves
 *                 the daemon — the daemon-side emission site skips the
 *                 broadcast and nothing else consumes it.
 *   - 'internal' — the verdict gate REJECTED the candidate (subagent stop,
 *                 leftover background work, turn-gate miss, already announced,
 *                 or a working cue rebutted the window). Status dot only: no
 *                 toast, no lifecycle tee, and — unlike 'emit'/'dedup' — no
 *                 dedup-ledger write, so a later same-turn candidate can still
 *                 arbitrate cleanly. Main treats it exactly like 'veto'.
