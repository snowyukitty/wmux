// Canonical pane-agent identity — the tier rule from issue #919.
//
// A pane's agent used to be decided by ONE signal: what the terminal printed
// (AgentDetector's screen gates), which cannot tell an agent from a sentence
// about an agent (#916: a Grok pane labelled Claude, twice). This module folds
// the three available signals into one precedence:
//
//   hook self-report  >  process image truth  >  screen chrome
//
// The hook tier is NOT unconditional: a hook authority is a 30-minute map
// entry, and letting it win on age alone reproduces #916 for half an hour
// after the agent exits (the panel's top finding). A hook wins only when
// CORROBORATED (a live same-slug process) or when FRESH and exactly routed
// and uncontradicted. Process truth — a live attributed process — beats both
// a stale hook and the screen. The screen stays the fallback for panes we
// cannot attribute (remote/SSH), which is why AgentDetector is untouched.
//
// Pure on purpose: no tracker/router imports, no clock, no I/O — the daemon
// reads its two maps and passes snapshots in, so every tier combination is
// unit-testable without a process table.

/**
 * The tier rule. Rows, in order:

 *  1. Residue veto — the tracked agent is CONFIRMED DEAD and the screen still
 *     says the same slug: that is the detector's sticky residue, not a live
 *     agent. No identity — UNLESS a fresh exact-routed hook backs the same
 *     slug: that is the relaunch itself (a live bridge fired from this very
 *     ptyId; the tracked entry is merely stale because the relaunch's arm()
 *     can sit out the failure backoff), and row 3 must be allowed to answer.
 *  2. Corroborated hook — a live same-slug process backs the authority.
 *     Age and routing are irrelevant here: the process IS the evidence.
 *  3. Fresh exact-routed hook, uncontradicted — the bridge signaled within
 *     IDENTITY_TTL and was routed by exact ptyId, and no live process of a
 *     DIFFERENT slug contradicts it. A dead or slugless tracked process does
 *     not contradict (the hook may be the relaunch; the pick may be the
 *     wrapper the agent runs under).
 *  4. Live process truth — an attributed, live process beats a stale hook
 *     and the screen. This row is the #916 fix: after claude exits and codex
 *     re-arms the tracker, claude's stale authority cannot win.
 *  5. Screen — the fallback for unattributable panes (remote/SSH).
