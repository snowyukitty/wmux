/**
 * #1730 — mirrors "the permission gate can be answered right now" into a file
 * a WSL hook can test for the cost of one stat (WSL_GATE_FLAG_FILE in
 * src/shared/wslIntegration.ts). Without it, every tool call in a WSL pane
 * would start a Windows process to ask a gate that is almost always dormant.
 *
 * The file is a hint, never an authority: the daemon still decides each gate
 * over the authenticated pipe. A stale file (daemon crashed) costs a WSL pane
 * one bridge spawn per tool call, which then fails open; a missing one only
 * means the gate is off. The daemon syncs right after the web server starts,
 * stops or is restored and on the runtime switch; the poll is the backstop
 * for any other change.
