/**
 * The ONE danger verdict on an approval request, shared by every notification
 * path.
 *
 * It lives in its own module because there are now two consumers with very
 * different consequences — the sealed phone payload, where the verdict decides
 * whether a one-tap lock-screen approve button exists, and the outbound
 * webhook/ntfy sink, where it decides how loudly the phone rings. A second copy
 * of this logic is not a duplication smell, it is a future disagreement about
 * what counts as dangerous: the day someone tightens one scan, the other path
 * keeps calling `rm -rf` ordinary. One function, one verdict, both callers.
 *
 * Note what does NOT leave here: only a boolean. The strings scanned are
 * agent-authored text that the webhook path must never transmit.

 * the choice rule changes this must not quietly become the gap.
 *
 * A permission gate (#783) carries no question and no choices — the thing being
 * approved is the tool call itself. Scanning only the question would score every
 * gate as `normal` and light up the one-tap lock-screen button for `rm -rf` with
 * nothing on screen to read (review: Claude). The tool name and its input
