// Is the person already looking at the desktop app?

// app is open, connected, and its window was focused moments ago, the phone
// buzzing is pure noise — the same approval is already sitting in the in-app
// inbox that the user is staring at. This module answers "is the desktop
// present?" and nothing else.
//
// Deliberately NOT inside PushSender. The decision is about the human, not
// about the transport: an approval push, a webhook, and any future sink all
// want the same answer, and a predicate that lives in one sender's internals
// can only ever be consulted by that sender. Call sites ask this module and
// then decide.
//
// Two bits are required, never one. "A client is connected" is not presence —
// the desktop app stays connected while it sits minimized behind a full-screen
// editor for an hour. "A window was focused at time T" is not presence either
// once T is old enough. Presence is connected AND recently focused.
//
// Suppression is a DEFERRAL, not a drop. See `DeferredPushQueue` below: a
// suppressed push is parked and delivered the moment presence goes away while
// the approval is still pending. Suppressing without that is data loss — the
// user walks away from a focused window and the prompt they were meant to
// answer from the phone never arrives.
