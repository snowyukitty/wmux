/**
 * Durable record of the operator's "yes, serve this" for `wmux web` (#596).
 *
 * Sessions survive a daemon restart by design; before this, the server that
 * serves them did not. The web server is started ONLY by an explicit
 * `daemon.web.start` (CLI or titlebar popover), and nothing remembered that
 * across a crash, a reboot, or the one-click updater's restart — so phone
 * access died silently and could only be revived by a human at the desktop,
 * which is precisely the situation phone access exists for.
 *
 * The lazy-init default is deliberately NOT changed here: with no state file
 * (a fresh install, or an operator who never ran `wmux web`) nothing listens.
 * What is restored is an explicit operator decision, nothing more.
 *
 * ── Why its own file, not `config.json` ────────────────────────────────────
 * The record carries the web bearer token, and config.json is hand-edited and
 * routinely pasted into bug reports. This file is 0600 and holds nothing an
 * operator would want to edit by hand — the same posture as the sibling
 * `daemon-auth-token`, including synchronous filesystem hardening for every
 * secret-bearing write. Keeping it separate also means a malformed web state
 * can never take config.json's core structure down with it.

 * for never retaining a credential on an inode we could not harden. Returns
