/**
 * M3 — the per-device credential roster for `wmux web` (`devices.json`).
 *
 * Replaces "every paired phone shares the server-wide bearer token" with a
 * credential per device that can be revoked on its own. The credential is
 * `<deviceId>.<secret>`: the id is a public handle, the secret is 256 bits of
 * CSPRNG that exists in exactly two places — the phone, and (as a salted hash)
 * `devices.json`. Parsing that string and checking the server-wide OPERATOR
 * token belong to `WebTerminalServer`; this module only ever answers about a
 * device, and never learns the operator's secret.
 *
 * ── What is on disk, and what is not ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The secret is NEVER persisted. Each record carries a per-device salt and the
 * scrypt output for that secret, so the file is not a credential: an attacker
 * who reads it gains nothing usable, which is what lets the ACL hardening below
 * be deferred instead of blocking the write.
 *
 * ── Hashing parameters, and why they are deliberately modest ───────────────
 * scrypt, N=4096 (2^12), r=8, p=1, 32-byte key, 16-byte per-device salt,
 * parameters stored PER RECORD so they can be raised later without a flag day.
 *
 * N=4096 rather than the password-grade 2^14-2^17 because the input is not a
 * password: `mint` generates 32 CSPRNG bytes (256 bits), so guessing the secret
 * from the hash is infeasible at ANY work factor, and the thing scrypt actually
 * buys here is the per-device salt — no precomputation, no cross-device or
 * cross-file reuse of work.
 *
 * Against that, cost is a real liability. Derivation is `scryptSync`, so it
 * blocks the daemon's event loop — the same loop that pumps PTY bytes to every
 * pane — and anyone who can reach the port can force one derivation per request
 * by presenting a known device id with a wrong secret. 2^12 keeps that at
 * roughly 10-15ms / 4 MiB instead of the ~60-90ms / 16 MiB of 2^14, an order of
 * magnitude less stall per hostile request for no meaningful loss against a
 * 256-bit secret. (`scryptSync` over the async form on purpose: the async one
 * runs on libuv's 4-thread pool, which is shared with every fs operation the
 * daemon makes, so saturating it would stall session writes instead. Neither
 * form is a DEFENCE — request rate limiting at the HTTP layer is — but this one
 * fails in the more predictable direction.)
 *
 * The derived-key cache below removes the cost from LEGITIMATE traffic
 * entirely: a device pays one derivation per daemon boot, then a bare SHA-256.

   * REVOKING input must take effect immediately whatever the disk does (the
   * next request is gated on the record, so the device stops typing now, and
   * `ok:false` tells the operator to retry before a restart). GRANTING input
   * that fails to persist is the same shape, and it is fine — the extra
   * capability evaporates on restart rather than outliving the roster.
   *
   * No cache invalidation: `verified` caches the SECRET derivation, which this
   * does not touch, and the grant is read from the record on every request.
   *
   * Audited only when the grant actually changes, and written even when the
   * persist fails: the change took effect in memory either way, and that is
   * the moment someone asking "who took this phone's keyboard away?" cares
   * about. `actor` defaults to `desktop` for the same reason as on `revoke`.
