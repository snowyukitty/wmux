 * (`session.bufferSizeMb` / `bufferMaxMb` in daemon config), and base64 inflates
 * whatever we send by a third — so a phone that reconnects every time the train
 * passes a tunnel pulled a multi-megabyte payload each time, and the daemon
 * copied the ring to build it. A terminal viewport is ~80x25; the initial paint
 * only has to fill a screen and leave a little scrollback.
 *
 * The hard part is WHERE to cut. The ring holds raw PTY bytes: UTF-8 sequences
 * and ANSI/OSC escapes both span several bytes, and a cut inside either one
 * makes xterm render a replacement char or, worse, swallow the following text
 * as the tail of a broken escape. So the naive offset is only a starting point
 * — `capSnapshot` walks FORWARD from it to a boundary that is safe to start
 * reading at, and never backward, so the result is never larger than the cap.
 *
 * Every scan in here is bounded by a named constant (see below): the total work
 * per call is independent of the buffer size, so a pathological buffer cannot
 * turn a repeated reconnect into a repeated O(n) walk.
