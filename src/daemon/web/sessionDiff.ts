/**
 * "What did this agent change?" — the working-tree diff of a pane's repository,
 * for the phone to read BEFORE it answers an approval.
 *
 * An approval prompt on a phone is a decision made with almost no context: the
 * screen tail says `Edit file? (y/n)` and nothing about what the edit is. The
 * pane's cwd is usually a git working tree, and git already holds the exact
 * answer, so this module reads it.
 *
 * Security posture (the whole reason this is a separate module):
 *   - READ-ONLY git only. Fixed argv: `rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
 *     --show-toplevel`, `config --list --name-only`, `diff`, `diff --cached`,
 *     `status --porcelain`, and one `diff --no-index` per untracked file.
 *     Nothing here writes, fetches, checks out, or runs a hook.
 *   - NO REF ARGUMENTS FROM THE CLIENT. There is no `?ref=`, no `?base=`, no
 *     pathspec. `git diff <ref>` accepts things that are not refs (`--output=`,
 *     `--ext-diff` with a configured driver), so the argv is a constant and the
 *     only variable is the cwd.
 *   - "READ-ONLY" IS NOT THE SAME AS "HARMLESS". git reads configuration out of
 *     the repository being inspected, and a repository an agent cloned is
 *     attacker-controlled input. `diff.external`, a `.gitattributes` textconv
 *     or diff driver, and `core.fsmonitor` are all *commands git will execute*
 *     that live inside the checkout. Every invocation is therefore neutered
 *     twice over — by `GIT_HARDENING_CONFIG` on the argv and by
 *     `buildGitEnv()` on the environment. See both for the details.
 *   - THE CWD IS THE DAEMON'S, NOT THE CALLER'S. It comes from the session
 *     record the daemon itself wrote at spawn time (`ManagedSession.meta
 *     .spawnCwd` — deliberately NOT `meta.cwd`, which the daemon updates at
 *     runtime from OSC 7 sequences the pane's own process emits), looked up by
 *     session id. A request cannot name a directory, so this cannot be turned
 *     into "read any repo on the machine".
 *   - `execFile`, never a shell, so a path with a space/quote/`;` in it is an
 *     argument and not syntax.
 *   - Bounded: every command gets a timeout and a maxBuffer, and the assembled
 *     patch is capped before it reaches the socket.
 *
 * A cwd that is not inside a git repo is a NORMAL answer, not an error — panes
 * run in `~`, in `/tmp`, in scratch directories. The caller turns that into a
 * 409 with `not-a-git-repo` so the phone can say so plainly.
 */

 * Cap on the assembled patch. Sized like the SSE snapshot window

 * to answer one y/n, and a generated-file commit can produce tens of megabytes

 *   - `diff.relative=false` — from a subdirectory, a repo-set `diff.relative`
 *     would hide every change outside that subdirectory from the patch while
 *     `status --porcelain` (always repo-root relative) still listed them.
 *
 * These are belt to the braces of `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv` on the diff

 * closes the ENVIRONMENT routes, which are the ones an operator's own shell can

 *
 *   - Inheriting `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` from the daemon's environment would run
 *     that program on every hunk — the exact thing `diff.external=` blocks on

 *   - `GIT_DIR` / `GIT_WORK_TREE` / `GIT_INDEX_FILE` would silently redirect
 *     the whole operation away from the cwd we carefully pinned, which would
 *     defeat the "the caller cannot name a directory" property.
 *   - `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` / `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` are a second, invisible `-c`
 *     channel that could put `core.fsmonitor` straight back.
 *
 * Building the allowlist forward rather than deleting known-bad names means a
 * `GIT_*` variable invented in a future git release is excluded by default
 * instead of by whoever remembers to update a denylist. The system-level config
 * and attributes files are switched off for the same reason the repo-level ones
 * are neutered — this command should behave identically wherever it runs.
 *
 * NOTE ON SCOPE: `GIT_ATTR_NOSYSTEM` disables the SYSTEM gitattributes only.
 * The repository's own `.gitattributes` is still read (git offers no way to
 * ignore it), which is fine: the drivers it can name are disarmed by
