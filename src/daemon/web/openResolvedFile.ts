 * volume serial (see `sameFileIdentity` in webStateStore.ts); when one side
 * has no volume, the path is opened once more and the two handles compared,
 * so both sides come from the same kind of stat. That open is one more lookup

/**
 * Open, for reading, a path the caller has already found inside its boundary
 * — and refuse it if that is no longer what the path names. Resolves to the
 * handle, or to `null` for every refusal, so the caller answers with the one
 * 404 it gives a path that is not there.
 *
 * `real` MUST be what the NATIVE realpath returned: `fs.promises.realpath` or
 * `fs.realpathSync.native`. The last check below compares realpath's answer
 * with `real` byte for byte, and only the native one spells a path the way the
 * filesystem does. JS `fs.realpathSync` keeps the caller's casing on a
 * case-insensitive volume (NTFS, default APFS), and `path.resolve` output is
 * not resolved at all; hand in either and legitimate files are refused.
 *
 * Before the open, the path must be a regular file. `real` came out of
 * realpath with every link resolved, so a link here was swapped in since, and
 * a directory, device or FIFO never was a file; none of them is opened. On
 * POSIX the flags cover the moment after that check: O_NOFOLLOW refuses a
 * link swapped into the last component, and O_NONBLOCK opens a FIFO swapped
 * in without parking the request (and its handle) on a writer, for the check
 * on the handle to refuse. On win32 neither flag exists, and a named pipe
 * looks like a regular file by path anyway: it passes the check and IS
 * opened, which connects to it, and the check on the handle refuses it before
 * anything is read.
 *
 * After the open, on every platform, the HANDLE is the judge: it must be a
 * regular file, the path must still name that same file without a link in its
 * last component, and realpath must still give `real` back. The last is what
 * catches a DIRECTORY on the way that became a junction or symlink, which
 * O_NOFOLLOW never covered on POSIX either.
 *
 * This narrows the window between the boundary check and the open; it does
 * not close it. A swap made before the open and undone again between the
 * lookups by path after it (the lstat and the realpath, plus the second open
 * `sameFile` makes where a path stat has no volume) gets through, and winning
 * that takes no precise timing: a process that keeps flipping a directory on
 * the path to a link and back (atomically on POSIX, with renameat2
 * RENAME_EXCHANGE or renamex_np RENAME_SWAP) gets some fraction of requests
 * through. Closing it needs the
 * path of the open handle itself, which Node has no API for on Windows or
 * macOS. Linux has one, a readlink of `/proc/self/fd/<fd>`, but that spelling
 * comes from the dentry cache: on a case-insensitive mount it can differ from
 * `real` for the very same file, so comparing the two would refuse legitimate
 * files.
