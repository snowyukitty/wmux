/**
 * "Active now" for the paired-device roster.
 *
 * A device is active when it is holding a live stream right now OR it made an
 * authenticated request within the window. Both halves are needed:
 *
 *   - A stream is opened with a ticket and never re-authenticates, so a phone
 *     watching a pane for an hour has a stale `lastSeenAt` while plainly
 *     present (SSE-only).
 *   - A client that polls (the desktop's remote attach, a phone app between
 *     streams) holds no stream but touches `lastSeenAt` on every request.
 *
 * A registered push token is deliberately NOT activity: a phone in a pocket
 * that only receives notifications is paired, not present. A revoked device is
 * never active, whatever its timestamp says.
