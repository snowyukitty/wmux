/**
 * The Content-Security-Policy the browser terminal is served under (M3 §6).
 *
 * WHY IT IS A PREREQUISITE, NOT A POLISH: the security review rated "no CSP"
 * LOW **because the web token died on every daemon restart** — an XSS could
 * only ever steal a secret that was about to expire. M3 made credentials
 * durable and individually long-lived, which invalidates that rating: an XSS on
 * this page now steals a device credential that works until somebody revokes
 * it. `script-src` restricted to the exact hashes of the three blocks the build
 * inlined is what stops that, and it is the load-bearing directive here.
 *
 * WHY THE HASHES ARE DERIVED FROM THE SERVED BYTES rather than read from a file
 * the build wrote: a header and a page that disagree fail CLOSED — the page
 * blocks its own code and the terminal is a blank screen. Deriving the policy
 * from `terminal.html` itself means the two cannot drift by construction, in
 * dev, in a packaged build, or after a partial copy. `scripts/build-daemon-web.mjs`
 * computes the same hashes and fails the BUILD when the page it just wrote
 * cannot be hashed cleanly, so a broken page never reaches the server at all.

/**
 * `style-src` — the one directive that is NOT hash-pinned, deliberately, with
 * the reason recorded here rather than hidden in a commit message.
 *
 * xterm 6.0.0 creates three `<style>` elements at runtime (the theme block, the
 * cell-dimension block, and the shared-stylesheet helper) and fills them with
 * values it computes from the measured font — px sizes and theme colours that
 * differ per device and per zoom level. Their content cannot be enumerated at
 * build time, so no hash can name them, and xterm exposes no nonce option
 * (`grep -c nonce node_modules/@xterm/xterm/lib/xterm.js` → 0). Under a
 * hash-only `style-src` a real Chromium refuses all three
 * (`effectiveDirective: 'style-src-elem'`, `blockedURI: 'inline'`) and the
 * terminal renders with no cell metrics and no theme — a blank screen, not a
 * degraded one. Adding the page's own hash alongside `'unsafe-inline'` would be
 * worse than useless: per CSP3 a hash present in a directive makes
 * `'unsafe-inline'` be IGNORED, so that spelling is the broken one.
 *
 * What that costs is bounded by the directives around it: CSS cannot exfiltrate
 * anything here because `default-src 'none'` and `img-src 'self' data:` leave a
 * stylesheet no outbound URL to load. What it does NOT cost is `script-src`,
 * which stays pinned to exact hashes — that is the directive standing between
 * an injected `<script>` and a durable device credential.
 *
 * The fix is upstream: an `ITerminalOptions.nonce` in xterm would let this
 * become `style-src 'nonce-…'`. Until then this is the honest spelling.

 *
 * `worker-src` and `manifest-src` are here because `default-src 'none'` would
 * otherwise take two shipped features with it — CSP falls `worker-src` back to
 * `script-src`, so a hash-pinned `script-src` refuses `navigator.serviceWorker
 * .register('/sw.js')` ("Note that 'worker-src' was not explicitly set, so
 * 'script-src' is used as a fallback"), and `manifest-src` falls all the way

 *
 * `font-src 'self'` is for the browser app page (`/app`), which renders the
 * desktop's own UI and terminal fonts. They are served by this daemon under
 * `/app/assets/` — same-origin files, never `data:` and never a third party —
 * so the page still makes zero external requests. The classic page loads no
 * font file, so the directive grants it nothing it uses.
 *
 * `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` (with `wasm: true`) lets the page compile WebAssembly,
 * which the inline image decoders (sixel and base64) are built on (#1641). It
 * allows no string evaluation of JavaScript; that still needs `'unsafe-eval'`,
 * which is absent. A browser without CSP3 ignores the keyword and keeps
 * refusing wasm, so the client probes before loading the image addon. Never
 * added beside `'none'`.
