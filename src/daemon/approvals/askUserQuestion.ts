// A4 — pull the QUESTION and its OPTION LABELS out of a PreToolUse envelope.
//
// Why this exists: approve is encoded as "press the first option" (see
// approvalKeystrokes.ts), and a pending request that does not say WHAT is being
// asked makes that press blind. "Approve" is a safe word for a consent-shaped
// question and a dangerous one for "which file should I delete?" — the phone
// has to show the question text and the options it is choosing between, or the
// operator is answering a question they cannot read.
//
// The input is the raw Claude Code hook payload, forwarded verbatim by the
// bridge (`payload: {...(payload ?? {})}` in wmux-bridge.mjs). It is
// AGENT-AUTHORED and therefore untrusted in both senses that matter here:
//   - shape: any field may be missing or any type. Every access is guarded and
//     an unrecognized shape yields absent fields, never a throw and never a
//     blocked request creation. A request with no question text is still worth
//     far more than no request at all.
//   - content: these strings land in approvals.json, in an HTTP body, and on a
//     phone screen. They are cleaned of control characters (an agent can put
//     ANSI escapes in an option label) and hard-truncated before any of that.
//
// The sanitising follows src/shared/activitySummary.ts, which solves the same
// problem for the Fleet activity line: cap the raw string BEFORE any regex work
// so a multi-MB field cannot make the control-char scan do O(n) work, then
// strip, collapse, trim, and truncate to the display cap.
