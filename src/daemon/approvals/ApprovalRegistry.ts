// M2 — ApprovalRegistry: the daemon is the process of record for approvals.
//
// M1 made the daemon the hook authority: with the GUI closed a Claude Code
// `AskUserQuestion` PreToolUse still lands here as an `agent.awaiting_input`
// with the full envelope. This module turns that signal into a REQUEST a human
// can answer from somewhere that is not the desktop, and owns the one dangerous
// step that follows — putting a keystroke into somebody's terminal.
//
// ASCII flow:
//
//   Claude Code AskUserQuestion (PreToolUse)
//      │  wmux-bridge.mjs → daemon.hooks.signal
//      ▼
//   HookIngest.handle → decision 'emit', source 'hook'
//      │  noteHookAwaitingInput(...)          [dedup'd signals never get here]
//      ▼
//   ApprovalRegistry   ── create ──▶ approvals.json + 'create' event
//      ▲                                          │
//      │ resolve({id, decision, resolvedBy})      ▼
//   daemon.approvals.resolve / POST /api/approvals/:id     SSE 'approval'
//      │
//      ├─ CAS on (id, state==='pending')  ──▶ 'already-resolved' for the loser
//      ├─ keystroke map (claude only)     ──▶ 'unsupported-agent'
//      ├─ re-read the pane's screen       ──▶ 'prompt-gone' (and EXPIRE it)
//      └─ ONE keystroke into the PTY      ──▶ state 'resolved'
//
// Three rules carry all the safety:
//
//  1. HOOK-ONLY CREATION. A request exists only for `source:'hook'` +
//     `agent.awaiting_input` + `decision:'emit'`. Detector (regex) awaiting_input
//     creates nothing — that is the CommanderEventCoalescer bar (a regex match
//     is a suspicion, and this surface writes bytes), enforced here rather than
//     described in a prompt.
//
//     ONE EXCEPTION: `kind:'terminal_prompt'`, the agent's own terminal dialog
//     (Claude Code's "Do you want to proceed?"). It is created from the
//     PermissionRequest hook AND from a confirmed detector attention, and it
//     does not need the hook bar, because its ANSWER never trusts its origin:
//     a remote answer is honoured only from a capable web client, only as a
//     plain Yes/No option, and only after the live screen is re-read, re-parsed
//     and found to be the same active dialog (fingerprint), with the pane
//     unchanged between that read and the one-byte write (see
//     resolveTerminalPrompt). A record whose parse was not whole carries no
//     choices and can never be answered; `resolve` refuses it with
//     `answer-in-terminal` and writes nothing.
//  2. ONE MUTATION CHAIN. Every state change funnels through `this.chain`, so a
//     read-modify-write can never interleave with another one across the awaits
//     in resolve() (the screen re-read is seconds long). This is the
//     deckDecisionStore lesson: two concurrent resolvers both reading 'pending'
//     is how a human's answer gets lost, and it is a race you cannot test your
//     way out of after the fact.
//  3. NEVER BLIND BYTES. The state says 'pending', but the state is a memory of
//     something that was true when the hook fired. Before writing we re-read the
//     actual screen and refuse unless the thing the keystroke acts on is still
//     visible (see looksLikeApprovalPrompt — biased to refuse).
