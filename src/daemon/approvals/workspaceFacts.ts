// ─── Workspace fact table — the daemon's copy of two main-process facts ─────
//
// `decideApprovalPress` refuses an AUTOMATED approve unless the target pane's
// workspace is a WorkTask task workspace whose deck autonomy is on. Neither
// fact exists in the daemon: task membership lives in the WorkTask projection
// and the autonomy mode is a main-process store. So main PUSHES them, over
// `daemon.workspaceFacts.set`, on every change — the same direction and the
// same transport `daemon.setResumeBinding` already uses to hand main-side facts
// down. No new channel, no daemon→main call (the daemon must keep working with
// the GUI closed, and a fact it cannot fetch would just become a hang).
//
// FULL REPLACEMENT, not a patch. A workspace that stops being a task workspace,
// or is deleted, has to be able to LEAVE the table, and a diff protocol between
// two processes that restart independently is a resynchronisation problem this
// does not need: the table is small (one row per workspace) and main can always
// rebuild it from its own stores.
//
// UNPUBLISHED IS NOT EMPTY. Before main's first push the answer is `null` —
// "not established" — which the registry reports as `scope-unavailable`, the
// refusal that says the wiring is missing. An empty published table is a
// different answer: main is connected and says no workspace qualifies, which
// refuses each press as `workspace-unknown`. Collapsing the two would make a
// daemon running without a GUI look like a policy decision.
