// M2 — keystroke map v1 and the pre-write screen check.
//
// These two pieces are what stand between "a phone tapped Approve" and "bytes
// entered someone's terminal", so both are deliberately narrow and both fail
// toward doing nothing.
//
// ── What a hook-sourced awaiting_input ACTUALLY is (read this before editing
//    the bytes below) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The registry only ever acts on `source:'hook'` + `agent.awaiting_input`. For
// Claude Code that signal has two origins, and only ONE of them reaches here:
//   - the PreToolUse hook wired to the `AskUserQuestion` matcher
//     (integrations/claude/hooks/hooks.json), which the bridge re-checks by
//     tool name before sending (integrations/claude/bin/wmux-bridge.mjs —
//     `tool_name === 'AskUserQuestion'`, every other PreToolUse is dropped);
//   - the PermissionRequest hook behind Claude's PERMISSION prompts ("Do you
//     want to proceed?"). HookIngest.noteAwaitingInput refuses to create a
//     record for it (`hook_event_name === 'PermissionRequest'`): it carries no
//     question, and the mapping below is built for a select. It is pane status
//     only. Without that hook installed the prompt is detector-only, which is
//     why HookIngest.arbitrateDetector exempts awaiting_input from the
//     hook-authority veto, and why M2 refuses to act on detector-sourced
//     signals.
//
// So the prompt on screen when we press is an AskUserQuestion SELECT: a
// question with the agent's own numbered options, rendered by Claude's TUI with
// a `❯` cursor on the highlighted row. It is NOT a y/N prompt. That rules out
// the obvious-looking `y` + CR: `y` is not a shortcut on a select, it would be
// typed into the composer as literal text, and the CR would then submit that
// text as a chat message — a silent, wrong, unrecoverable action.
//
// Sources consulted for the mapping:
//   - src/main/deck/deckAutonomyStore.ts — the `approvalPress` capability is
//     documented as "the brain may press y/1/2/3 on an approval prompt", i.e.
//     the option DIGIT is the press wmux already reasons about.
//   - src/mcp/index.ts `terminal_send_key` — reserved for "real key presses:
//     ctrl+c, escape, arrow keys, and y/N approval prompts".
//   - src/main/pty/AgentDetector.ts — the claude approval-prompt regexes are
//     anchored to whole boxed lines, which is where the option list renders.
//
// ── The mapping ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// approve → '1'   the FIRST offered option. On a select, the digit both moves
//                 the selection and confirms it, so no CR is appended: an extra
//                 CR would land on whatever the TUI renders NEXT (often the
//                 composer, sometimes a fresh prompt) and press it blind. One
//                 byte, one effect.
// deny    → ESC   cancels the tool call; Claude receives the rejection and
//                 continues its turn. This is the same escape hatch the prompt
//                 itself advertises, and it is the only mapping here that is
//                 unambiguous for ANY question shape.
//
// DEFAULT MAPPING + per-option override. For a yes/no question '1' is the
// affirmative answer, but AskUserQuestion options are agent-authored, so on a
// question whose first option is not the affirmative one, "approve" means
// "pick the first option" rather than "say yes". Nothing on the wire tells us
// which is which at the default-mapping layer.
//
// Per-option press is now supported: the registry extracts structured
// `choices` (key = the original 1-based digit, label) from the hook payload,
// and a resolver may send `choiceKey` to select a SPECIFIC option rather than
// the default first. The registry validates the key belongs to the request,
// re-verifies the option row is visible, then sends exactly that digit — no CR.
// Omitting `choiceKey` preserves the default mapping byte-for-byte, so old
// clients keep working. See ApprovalRegistry.resolve and the phone-client
// contract (`docs/phone-client-contract.md`, "choices" / "choiceKey").

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The checks above answer "can these bytes be pressed". This one answers the
// prior question: "may this pane be pressed AT ALL". They are different, and
// conflating them is how an AUTOMATED approve reaches a pane a human opened
// for themselves — a keystroke into a session nobody delegated.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT GOVERN, and must not:
//   - a HUMAN answering from the phone or the web UI. They are looking at the
//     prompt; a scope check that refuses them is just a broken button, and a
//     refused deny would leave the record alive to be re-tapped forever.
//   - a DENY, from any caller. Denying is the safe direction: it cancels the
//     tool call and hands the turn back. Refusing a deny keeps a pane blocked
//     to protect it from being unblocked.
//
// Four conditions, all required (for an automated APPROVE):
//   1. the target pane's workspace is a WorkTask TASK workspace. A pane the
//      human opened by hand, and the PARENT workspace a fan-out was launched
//      from, are both refused: neither was delegated to an agent;
//   2. that workspace's EFFECTIVE approvalPress capability is on. Not the mode:
//      main composes the stored capability as `modeCeiling AND loop tier`
//      (deck.handler applyTierCaps), so a `danger` workspace running a `report`
//      loop has press OFF while its mode still reads 'danger'. Reading the mode
//      here would press in a workspace whose own UI says it may not;
//   3. the pending approval came from a HOOK. The screen-regex detector is a
//      suspicion — it fires on a numbered list in a diff — and this surface
//      writes bytes;
//   4. a re-read taken NOW still shows the prompt (looksLikeApprovalPrompt).
//      Everything upstream is a fact about when the hook fired, which is not
//      a fact about the screen a press is about to land on.
//
// Two more, added with the HQ approval lane (C2 v2, 2026-10-04), for every
// automated approve whichever process relays it:
//   5. the task's single open OWNER is in `danger` right now. The task
//      workspace's own mode is a copy taken at fan-out; the owner's live mode
//      is the operator's current word, so a downgrade after the fan-out stops
//      presses at once instead of when the copy catches up;
//   6. the record is not flagged `risk: 'critical'`. The flag is a regex hint
//      (shared/criticalPatterns), so it misses and over-fires — but it only
//      ever withholds an AUTOMATED approve. The human still answers it.
//      Checked FIRST, before any workspace fact;
//   7. the record's hook named this pane exactly (`attribution: 'exact'`);
//   8. a caller that declared the HQ lane finds main's lane policy still open
//      at the generation it checked.
//
// UNKNOWN IS A REFUSAL. Each fact is optional in the input because the daemon
// cannot see all of them yet (task-workspace membership and autonomy mode live
// in the main process), and a fact we cannot establish must never be assumed
// favourable: the cost of a wrong refusal is a human walking to the desktop,
// the cost of a wrong press is a keystroke in someone else's terminal.
