 * Daemon version of PTYBridge.
 * Replaces BrowserWindow IPC with EventEmitter events.
 *
 * Events:
 *  - 'data'     → Buffer (raw PTY output)
 *  - 'cwd'      → { sessionId: string, cwd: string }
 *  - 'agent'    → { sessionId: string, event: AgentEvent }
 *  - 'notification' → { sessionId, event: TerminalNotification & { ts } }
 *  - 'critical' → { sessionId: string, event: CriticalEvent }
 *  - 'usageLimit' → { sessionId: string, event: UsageLimitLineEvent }
 *  - 'inputSubmitted' → { sessionId: string } (input with a submit boundary)
 *  - 'active'   → { sessionId, agentName?, likelyRepaint? } — onActive cycle
 *                 start; likelyRepaint marks a passive burst inside the
 *                 resize-redraw guard window (alarm feeds must ignore it)
 *  - 'idle'     → { sessionId, preTurn? }              — onActiveToIdle;
 *                 preTurn marks silence after a SessionStart with no turn
 *                 started since (see isPreTurn)
 *  - 'exit'     → { sessionId: string, exitCode, signal }
 *  - 'answered' → { sessionId, reason: 'input' | 'screen-cleared' } — the
 *                 dialog the pane was blocked on closed
 *  - 'awaitingActivity' → { sessionId, cause: 'input' | 'output', ... } —
 *                 stdin or output while the pane is blocked on a human
 *  - 'fenceInput' → { sessionId } — a key, click, release or wheel reached stdin
 *  - 'typedInput' → { sessionId } — a key (not a mouse report) reached stdin;
 *                 at most once per TYPED_INPUT_THROTTLE_MS. Workspace settle
 *                 reads it as "someone is using this pane".
 *  - 'resize'   → (no payload) — an applied geometry change; consumers read the
 *                 new size from the session's own meta.
