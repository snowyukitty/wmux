/**
 * Roll the fleet selector up into one FleetSnapshot per workspace — but
 * SURFACE-accurate, which is where this deliberately diverges from the cockpit.
 *
 * The UI rollup (`selectFleetPanes`, fleet.ts) returns one row per leaf pane:
 * ptyId is the ACTIVE surface, but agentStatus is the most-urgent attention
 * status rolled across ALL of the leaf's surfaces — correct for a pane CARD (a
 * background tab awaiting input must light the card). For the mirror it is
 * wrong: the heartbeat's `[fleet-snapshot]` prompt tells the orchestrator
 * "pane=<ptyId> state=<status> — verify then press", so pairing the active
 * surface's ptyId with a background tab's attention status would aim the brain
 * at the wrong terminal (possible mis-approval). UI lights the pane; actuation
 * must target the surface.
 *
 * So per leaf we emit:
 *   1. one row per surface that holds its OWN retained attention status
 *      (ptyId = THAT surface, agentStatus = its `surfaceAgentStatus` entry), and
 *   2. for the pane's ACTIVE surface, when it carries no attention entry of its
 *      own, one row with the pane-level non-attention status (running/idle) —
 *      so single-surface panes are byte-identical to before and the fleet tail
 *      counts stay meaningful.
 *
 * `isActivePane` stays true only for a row whose surface is the workspace's
 * active pane's ACTIVE surface (a background tab of the active pane is false).
 * `agentName` follows the same active-pane/active-surface fidelity rule.
 *
 * Reuse: `selectFleetPanes` supplies the per-leaf derived status + agentName;
 * running it again over the SAME state with the attention map emptied collapses
 * each pane to its non-attention derivation (metaStatus / hookRunning / idle),
 * which is exactly the base status the active surface must carry when a
 * background surface holds the attention.
