/**
 * `workspace.close` must not hand out a false receipt (issue #799).
 *
 * The handler returned `{ok:true}` unconditionally, but `removeWorkspace` is a
 * silent no-op in two cases: an id that matches nothing, and the store's
 * last-workspace guard (wmux always keeps one workspace open). A scripted
 * cleanup therefore saw `Closed workspace: ws-…` for a workspace that was still
 * open — and the reporter's "confirmed-closed workspace reappeared and is now
 * the only workspace" was never a resurrection: it was the last one, the removal
 * was refused, and only the CLI lied about it.
 *
 * Same false-receipt class `getResultError()` (cli/utils.ts) was introduced for
 * on surface.close — the CLI already exits 1 on a payload-level `{error}`, so
 * returning one is all it takes for `close-workspace` to report honestly.
 *
 * handleRpcMethod is not exported and pulls in the store/window, so it can't be
 * imported under vitest (same constraint as useRpcBridge.browserClose.test.ts /
 * useRpcBridge.focus.test.ts); these are source-structural guards.
