// ─── Channel mention flush — Stop-triggered PTY delivery (P1 autoresponse) ────
//
// `channelMentionInbox.ts` queues an @-mention as an a2a inbox task but never
// touches the agent's terminal — the agent only sees it if it voluntarily runs
// `a2a_task_query`. This module is the "call → it answers" half: it pastes a
// ONE-LINE nudge into the mentioned pane's PTY at a SAFE moment (the agent's
// turn boundary / Stop, or right now if the pane is idle), so the agent picks
// the mention up as its next prompt and replies via `channel_post`.
//
// Why this is Stop-triggered, not paste-on-arrival (outside-voice redesign):
//   - `submitBracketedPasteToPty` submits with `\r` ~100ms after the paste, so
//     pasting into a BUSY agent injects text mid-turn and corrupts its input.
//   - A mention pasted into the working context also makes the agent spend its
//     task tokens on an unrelated channel ping (consumptive context).
//   So we leave the mention QUEUED (no paste) while the agent is busy, and
//   deliver only when it goes idle: either on its Stop lifecycle event (the
//   `agent.stop` we observe via events.poll) or immediately if it is already
//   idle at mention-arrival time. The body stays in the task store; the nudge
//   just points at it (`a2a_task_query <id>`) — the agent fetches the full text
//   only if it chooses to (context-cheap, like Claude Code's `/btw`).
//
// Pure + dependency-injected so it unit-tests without a store/window. The hook
// (`useChannelsEventSubscription`) wires the real store actions + PTY writer.
