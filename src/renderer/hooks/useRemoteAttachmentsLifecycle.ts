// ─── Remote attachment lifecycle ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The SINGLE owner of two things AppLayout has no other place for:
//
//  ① RESTORE. remoteWorkspacesSlice is memory-only, so a reload (Cmd+R) or an
//     app restart recreates it empty. Main persists the descriptors; this hook
//     replays them on boot, re-fetching each host's CURRENT panes rather than
//     trusting anything on disk. A host that cannot be reached, or a workspace
//     that no longer exists there, is restored in a `stale` state instead of
//     being dropped — a sleeping laptop must not delete the user's attachment.
//     Every row appears IMMEDIATELY (stale), before any host is contacted, and
//     the fetch only fills panes in: an unreachable host costs a full request
//     timeout, and the sidebar must not sit empty for that long.
//
//  ② PANE MEMBERSHIP. The remote wire carries no topology events, so pane
//     open/close on the remote never reaches us directly. A pane CLOSE does
//     surface indirectly (its PTY dies → SSE exit → REMOTE_PANE_EXIT), which
//     is used here as a refresh trigger; a pane OPEN produces nothing at all,
//     which is what the 10s poll is for. Both go through the same
//     refetch-and-diff, and both are debounced/serialised so an exit burst
//     costs one round of requests. No daemon-side change is involved, so this
//     keeps working against older remote builds (version skew is real here).
//
//     THE POLL'S CADENCE COMES FROM MAIN (#1391), not from a renderer timer.
//     Chromium throttles timers in a hidden or occluded renderer, and the 10s
//     interval was measured stretching to 17s and then 60s with the window in
//     the background — a user watching a remote agent from a background window
//     read minute-old status. Main's timers are never throttled, so main owns
//     the tick and the renderer owns everything the tick means:
//
//        main                                     renderer
//        ────                                     ────────
//        REMOTE_POLL_SUBSCRIBE  ◀──── while ≥1 workspace is attached
//        setInterval(10s) ─── TICK ────▶ refresh()  ─┐
//                                                    ├─ host set, backoff,
//        (no subscriber ⇒ no timer at all)           │  serialisation: all
//        REMOTE_POLL_UNSUBSCRIBE ◀── last detach     ┘  unchanged, all here
//
//     The tick carries no payload. `visibilitychange`→visible and window
//     `focus` additionally refresh straight away, so the first frame after
//     coming back is fresh rather than up to one tick old.
//
//  ③ SURFACE ROWS (#1329). A remote-terminal SURFACE — "New remote pane",
//     "Split right|down — remote" — is not an attachment: it lives in a local
//     pane tree and nothing ever put it in `remoteWorkspaces`. But ① and ②
//     above derive the polled host set from exactly that array, so such a pane
//     had no liveness feed at all, and both readers of the feed (the sidebar's
//     WorkspaceAgentRoster and `pane.list`'s `agents:` builder) reported no
//     agent no matter what was really running on the host (#1322).
//
//     Fixed by giving each such surface an EPHEMERAL row (invisible,
//     unpersisted — see AttachedRemoteWorkspace.ephemeral) and RECONCILING
//     that set against the surfaces that actually exist:
//
//        surfaces in state.workspaces          remoteWorkspaces
//        ────────────────────────────          ────────────────────────
//        remote-terminal + hostId
//          + remoteWorkspaceId   ──track──▶    { …, ephemeral: true }
//                                                     │
//        (tab closed / Ctrl+W / pane            prune │ key no longer
//         teardown / workspace delete /        ◀──────┘ produced by any
//         split rolled back / app quit)                 surface
//
//     Derivation is the whole point. The nine explicit teardown call sites
//     that destroy a remote session would each have needed a matching detach,
//     and any close path nobody enumerated would still have leaked a row.
//     Here every one of them ends the same way — the surface is gone from
//     `state.workspaces` — so the next reconcile drops the row and, with it,
//     the poll. Two panes on one host share one row, so there is never a
//     second poller for the same workspace.
//
// Every host in a round is queried in PARALLEL and every response is treated
// as untrusted: one dead or misbehaving machine must not delay, or abort, the
// round for the healthy ones.
//
// Actions are read via useStore.getState() so the effect deps stay minimal —
// mirrors useRemoteInboxBridge.

   * for is a window left in the background while a laptop slept: by the time the
   * user comes back the host is backed off up to BACKOFF_MAX_MS, so a plain

   *
   * THREE things keep that from becoming a request storm against a dead host:
   *
   *   · `nextAttemptAt`, not the whole entry. Dropping the entry would reset
   *     `failures` to 0, so the exponential ladder could never climb past one
   *     step while the user keeps switching windows — #1385's backoff, disarmed
   *     by a feature that is only supposed to skip one wait.
   *   · the in-flight drop, for the reason spelled out on `refreshTick`. A round
   *     against a sleeping host runs 20s while focus events keep arriving; if
   *     these queued, the `finally` would start the next round the instant the
   *     last one ended. The heartbeat path is guarded and this one has the same
   *     exposure — `focus` is bound raw, so alt-tab, DevTools closing, a tray
   *     show and a notification click all land here.
   *   · its OWN clock. Deliberately not `refresh`'s: a tick round in which every
   *     host is backed off issues no request at all, and letting that count as
   *     "just refreshed" would swallow the next return to the window — which is

  // ②-b Safety-net poll — armed only while something is attached, so an app
  //     with no mirrors makes no periodic requests at all.
  //
  //     The CADENCE comes from main (#1391). A renderer `setInterval` here was
  //     throttled to a minute once the window went to the background, which is
  //     exactly when a remote agent is the thing the user is watching.
  //
  //     The renderer interval survives only as a FALLBACK, armed the moment the
  //     tick cannot be had. THREE ways it can't, and the third is why a
  //     watchdog exists rather than just a rejection handler:
  //
  //       · no route at all — an older preload bundle, the same defence
  //         attachmentsList/hostsList already carry
  //       · the subscribe REJECTS — no handler registered on the main side
  //       · the subscribe SUCCEEDS and then the ticks simply stop. Main drops
  //         every subscriber on `will-quit` and in its disposer without telling
  //         anyone, and neither is a rejection. Without the watchdog the
  //         renderer sits on a live listener it believes is subscribed and
  //         polls nothing for the rest of the session — which is the one
  //         outcome this whole fallback exists to rule out.
  //
  //     Losing the tick must cost freshness, never the poll itself. Exactly one
  //     driver is ever live: arming the fallback tears the tick listener down.
  // A host whose rejected flag was cleared from outside a poll — it was just
  // paired again — has a slowest-rung deadline that is now meaningless. Drop
  // it and ask at once, so the rows come back without a five-minute wait.
