 * pasted into the caller's own prompt, and it identifies "provable" with "the

 * `isTerminalPtyInLeaves` rejects its pty, so `callerPtyId` arrives empty —

 * as unverified, and the brain was told its message was stored while the worker
 * sat waiting. A caller with no pane is precisely a caller a delivery cannot
 * loop back into, and MAIN has already validated the commander binding it
 * carries, so that ONE guard is satisfied rather than tripped.

 *     the delivery helpers fall back to the target workspace's ACTIVE pane —
 *     the #239 path — so relaxing it would hand an anchorless reply to
 *     whichever pane happens to be focused. A brain that wants a worker nudged
 *     addresses it (pane_id / surface_id), and then this guard never applies.
 *   - `self_loop` compares concrete pty ids, so it still protects every pane
 *     caller; a brain (empty callerPtyId) could never trip it anyway.
 *   - the binding must name the CALLER'S OWN workspace (see
