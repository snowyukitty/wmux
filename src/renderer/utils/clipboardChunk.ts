/**
 * Helpers for safely streaming clipboard text into the PTY.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   xterm.js handles paste itself when its native paste event fires
 *   (`Clipboard.ts` normalizes CRLF and wraps in bracketed-paste markers
 *   when the foreground app enabled DECSET 2004). wmux intercepts Ctrl+V,
 *   right-click paste, and drag-drop directly so we can read from
 *   Electron's clipboard API (not the browser's, which is gated and racy).
 *   That bypasses xterm's paste pipeline, so this module re-implements the
 *   three guarantees a terminal paste needs:
 *
 *     1. **Newline normalization** — collapse \r\n / \n / \r to a single
 *        separator that depends on bracketed mode (see normalizePasteText):
 *        LF inside a bracketed body (the readline in-body separator — a lone
 *        CR there makes PSReadLine misplace the cursor and inject blank
 *        space, the "multiline paste adds whitespace" bug), CR otherwise
 *        (each line is an Enter). An unnormalized \r\n boundary used to
 *        execute the first line mid-paste and strand the rest — the "front
 *        of paste disappears" symptom.
 *
 *     2. **UTF-16 surrogate safety** — never split an astral codepoint
 *        (emoji, CJK supplementary) across two chunks. UTF-16 high
 *        surrogates land at code-unit boundaries 0xD800-0xDBFF; if the
 *        chunk boundary falls between high and low surrogate, the
 *        chunked write produces a broken (`�`) character on the wire.
 *
 *     3. **IPC pacing** — yield to the event loop between chunks so the
 *        conpty input pipe drains. node-pty does not surface
 *        back-pressure to the JS layer (`IPty.write` is void), so a
 *        synchronous loop firing N IPC messages in one tick can overrun
 *        the ~64KB conpty pipe buffer on Windows.
 *
 *   The main process also enforces a 100KB silent backstop on `pty.write`
 *   (see `pty.handler.ts`) — chunking keeps us safely below that limit
 *   even when the user pastes a megabyte of log output.
 */

 * leaked through xterm's native paste path and should be chunked + paced.

/**
 * Normalize line endings in pasted text for the PTY wire. The correct
 * separator depends on whether the foreground app enabled bracketed paste
 * (DECSET 2004):
 *
 *   - NON-bracketed (`bracketed=false`, default): collapse every line break
 *     to a single CR. Each line is meant as an Enter, and every interactive
 *     shell (PowerShell, cmd, bash, zsh, fish) accepts CR as Enter via its
 *     line discipline. (Lone `\n` from *nix/WSL clipboards also becomes CR.)
 *
 *   - BRACKETED (`bracketed=true`): collapse to LF. Inside a bracket pair the
 *     body is INSERTED into the line editor, not executed, so the separator
 *     must be the readline in-body separator (LF) — NOT Enter. PSReadLine
 *     (and bash/zsh/fish readline) misplace the cursor and inject blank
 *     lines when they receive a lone CR as the in-body separator: the
 *     "multiline paste adds whitespace" bug (PSReadLine #3939, #417 — both
 *     recommend LF). Verified against real pwsh 7.6 / PSReadLine 2.4.5
 *     (scripts/paste-repro.cjs): a CR body splits the command line-by-line,
 *     an LF body buffers it as one multiline command.
 *
 * NOTE: this intentionally diverges from xterm.js, which normalizes to CR in
 * BOTH modes (xterm Clipboard.ts `prepareTextForTerminal`). wmux bypasses
 * xterm's paste pipeline (it reads Electron's clipboard directly for Ctrl+V /
 * right-click / drag-drop), so we own this choice and pick the separator that
 * actually works for the bracketed insert path.
