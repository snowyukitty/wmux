/**
 * "The app owns the mouse — hold Shift to select" hint.
 *
 * Background:
 * A foreground TUI that enables mouse tracking (DECSET ?1000/?1002/?1003,
 * usually with ?1006) takes every button press. Claude Code does exactly this
 * — its binary emits `ESC[?1000h` + `ESC[?1006h` while its input box is live —
 * so a left-drag over the pane is delivered to the agent instead of starting an
 * xterm selection. Nothing is broken and nothing is logged: the highlight
 * simply never appears, and the user concludes wmux cannot copy from that pane.
 *
 * xterm already ships the escape hatch: `SelectionService.shouldForceSelection`
 * returns `event.shiftKey` off macOS, so Shift+drag selects even under mouse
 * tracking (this is also what Windows Terminal and iTerm2 do). wmux leans on
 * the same override for Shift+right-click paste. It is just invisible — there
 * is no moment where the product says so.
 *
 * On macOS that same xterm method reads `event.altKey` instead, gated on
 * `macOptionClickForcesSelection` (#1437, which wmux now sets). So the modifier
 * that escapes is platform-dependent, and the caller supplies it: a hint that
 * names the wrong key is worse than none, and a drag that already forced a
 * selection must not be told the selection failed.
 *
 * This module is the trigger for saying it: a real drag attempt (button held
 * past a threshold, no Shift) in a pane whose app owns the mouse. A bare click
 * is not a selection attempt and must stay silent, and the hint is rate-limited
 * so an agent session that legitimately wants the mouse (a picker, a diff
 * viewer) does not nag on every click-drag.
 *
 * Deliberately pure: no DOM, no xterm, no timers of its own — the caller wires
 * the three events and supplies `show`. That keeps the decision unit-testable
 * without a renderer.
