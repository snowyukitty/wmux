// ─── Claude Code hook-bridge install prompt ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Completion/approval detection is HOOK-PRIMARY: without the wmux hook bridge
// every lifecycle signal degrades to the regex detector, which can miss a real
// stop behind a TUI redraw ("the orchestrator never noticed my agent finished").
// wmux deliberately does NOT edit ~/.claude/settings.json behind the operator's
// back (owner decision 2026-07-17) — instead this ONE modal nudges at the two
// moments the gap actually bites:
//
//   1. App launch: hooks missing → prompt once per session.
//   2. Agent mode raised off → assist/auto: the orchestrator is about to rely
//      on lifecycle signals, so the same prompt fires again (even if it was
//      dismissed at launch — raising the mode is a fresh reason to care).
//
// Mounted ONCE (AppLayout). Both triggers arrive via a window CustomEvent so
// the mode chip doesn't need to own modal state or an extra prop chain:
//   window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('wmux:hooks-install-prompt'))
//
// TWO refusals, deliberately different in lifetime. Dismissing used to set the
// local phase back to `hidden`, which did not even survive the NEXT trigger in
// the same session: `maybePrompt` re-enters from `hidden`, so raising the agent
// mode after clicking Later showed the identical modal again, and every launch
// asked again forever.
//
//   Later           — unchanged: hide THIS modal, and let trigger 2 ask again.
//                     Raising agent mode IS a fresh reason to care (see above),
//                     and a snooze must not be read as a refusal of a warning
//                     the user has not yet been given in the context where it
//                     matters. Nothing is written to disk.
//   Don't ask again — durable, via main's hooks-prompt.json. Survives restart
//                     and upgrade; cleared from Settings -> integration setup.
//
// The durable preference is re-read on EVERY trigger rather than cached at
// mount, so clearing it in Settings takes effect without a broadcast or a
// restart. Both the read failing and the bridge being too old to have it fall
// back to asking — the store's own default — because a silently muted prompt
// is invisible while an extra prompt is one click to dismiss.
//
// Self-contained IPC via injected api (jsdom-testable), defaulting to
// window.electronAPI.deck.hooksBridge in the container.
