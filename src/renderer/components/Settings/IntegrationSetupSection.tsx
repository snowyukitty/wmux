// ─── Settings → Claude integration — the setup card ──────────────────────────
//
// Everything wmux installs into someone else's config lives here, in one place,
// with its real state read from a probe rather than inferred.
//
// Why it exists: all three integrations shipped with a working IPC probe and an
// install path, but the only UI that ever offered them was the first-run
// wizard. Skip that once and there was no way back — the CLI commands
// (`wmux setup-hooks`, `wmux mcp register`, `wmux setup-statusline`) were the
// entire re-entry path, and an operator who could not remember them had no way
// to discover the feature existed. The wizard is a moment; settings is a place.
//
// Two rows are REQUIRED and one is RECOMMENDED, and the card says which:
//
//   hooks       required     lifecycle signals; without it every completion
//                            detection degrades to the regex fallback
//   mcp         required     the agent's access to wmux tools at all
//   statusline  recommended  model / context / rate limits under the input box;
//                            purely informational, costs nothing to run
//
// No nagging: this card never raises a banner or a toast. wmux does not edit
// ~/.claude/settings.json behind the operator's back (owner decision
// 2026-07-17), so every row's action is a button the human clicks. The one
// existing nudge (HooksInstallPrompt, at launch and on a mode raise) stays as
// it is — this card is the place you go, not a thing that comes to you.
