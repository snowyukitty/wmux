// ─── C-3: approval auto-reject countdown + the record of what expired ────
//
// An approval that nobody answers is auto-rejected. Until now the Fleet inbox
// showed that deadline for A2A rows only, and when a row expired it simply
// vanished — indistinguishable from someone approving it. These pure helpers
// give the list both halves: the remaining seconds while the row is alive, and
// a short log of the rows that died of the deadline.
//
// The deadline itself is data, not a guess: A2A rows carry `expiresAt`, and an
// MCP prompt carries `deadlineAt` once the daemon stamps it (Lane A). Without a
// deadline no badge is rendered — a countdown wmux cannot back with a real
// auto-reject would be a lie about what happens when you walk away.
