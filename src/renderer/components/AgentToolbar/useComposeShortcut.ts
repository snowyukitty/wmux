/**
 * ⌘G / Ctrl+G toggles Rich Input on the focused terminal.
 *
 * Mounted by ToolbarHost ABOVE its enabled gate, because the binding is
 * documented to survive the inject-chrome setting being off. Keeping it inside
 * AgentToolbar tied the shortcut to the bar's own mount, which silently
 * dropped it for anyone on a minimal chrome preset.
 *
 * It only sets `toolbarPopover`; the bar renders the popover. With the bar
 * hidden the state still flips, and the bar holds itself open for it — that is
 * the keyboard route in.
 *
 * #1280 — which keydowns ARE the chord is not decided here. The old inline
 * test, `(ctrlKey || metaKey) && (key === 'g' || key === 'G')`, accepted a
 * SUPERSET: `key` is 'G' precisely when Shift is held, so Ctrl+Shift+G — the
 * clearMultiview binding — also toggled Rich Input, and so did Ctrl+Alt+G.
 * Worse, useTerminal's pane gate had its own opinion of the same key, and
 * every condition one gate applied that the other could not see left the key
 * silently dead. Both gates now call one pure predicate; see
 * terminal/composeChord.ts.
 *
 * Note the one case this gate still loses: a user who bound a CUSTOM
 * keybinding to Ctrl+G wins via useKeyboard's `stopImmediatePropagation`, so
 * Rich Input never opens for them. Their explicit rebind beating the built-in
 * is the right precedence; it is just silent.
