 *
 * Semantics: `source: 'install'` is present on every error sent from an
 * install context (performInstall's refusals, the install watchdog, the
 * whole darwin install path) and never on background check/download
 * failures. `code: 'in-progress'` marks the re-entrancy refusal — shown,

 * all. Both were silently dropped by the window (#1055 review).

 * carries failed background polls (the first runs ~15s after launch) and
 * failed downloads, and an offline machine must not post "could not be
