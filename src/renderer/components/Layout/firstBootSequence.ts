 * One prompt at a time. A fresh launch used to stack the welcome dialog, a
 * "New: …" feature toast, the auto-update question, the spotlight tour and
 * the keyboard cheat sheet, each fired by its own trigger. Stacking made the
 * lower one pointer-dead under the upper one's backdrop, and most of them are
 * not something a new user needs yet. Now every self-opening surface goes
 * through this queue: the next one starts only when nothing else is on
 * screen, and the caller latches the start (mount → own modal layer → "a
 * dialog is open" must not unmount it again).
