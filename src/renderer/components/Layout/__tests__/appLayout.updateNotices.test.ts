/**
 * #897 — the "an update is waiting" notice, and why it is shaped this way.
 *
 * Structural test (house pattern: appLayout.sessionSaveInvariants.test.ts).
 * AppLayout has no jsdom fixture, and every property below is one a refactor
 * could undo with all other tests staying green — while the symptom is silence,
 * which is indistinguishable from "there was no update".
 *
 * The bug: a background poll downloads and verifies an installer, emits
 * UPDATE_AVAILABLE{downloaded} once, and the only listener is the Settings
 * panel — mounted only while Settings is OPEN. So the app sat on a ready
 * installer saying nothing. Two reporters and the maintainer described the same
 * thing: it downloads, nothing happens, and pressing "Check for updates" by
 * hand is the only way through (that path sets a one-shot install intent; the
 * background poll deliberately never does).
 *
 * This subsystem has now made that mistake three times: #866's refused-install
 * notice pushed into the same Settings-only listener, this notice did not exist
 * at all, and the Settings widget itself only subscribed and never asked what
 * was already true. Same fix each time — read from a surface that is actually
 * mounted — so these assertions exist to stop a fourth round.
 *
 * Both halves are needed and neither is sufficient: the mount read covers "it
 * was ready before you looked", the live subscription covers "it became ready
 * while you were working". A poll finishing an hour into a session is the
 * common case, and a mount-only fix would stay silent for it until restart.
