/**
 * The geometry a remote mirror needs to fit a grid it does not own.
 *
 * A mirror renders the REMOTE daemon's grid — `RemoteMirrorTerminal` only ever
 * calls `term.resize()` with cols/rows the remote sent, because geometry has a
 * single owner and a viewer must not resize someone else's pane. The pixels,
 * though, are local: the mirror draws with this app's font settings. So the
 * rendered element is `remoteCols × localCellW` wide and nothing relates that
 * to the box it sits in. When the remote pane is the bigger of the two, the
 * surplus columns and rows are cropped by the enclosing `overflow-hidden` — and
 * a TUI keeps its input box on the LAST rows, so the crop takes exactly the
 * part the user is looking at.
 *
 * The fix is to shrink the mirror's own font until the remote's grid fits.
 * Deliberately NOT a CSS transform: xterm derives every mouse coordinate from
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` divided by an unscaled cell width, so a scaled
 * mirror maps clicks to the wrong cell — and those clicks are not local
 * decoration, they leave as SGR mouse reports through `onData` → `paneWrite`
 * into a live remote shell. Changing the font size keeps xterm's own metrics
 * and the rendered size in agreement, so coordinates stay exact.
 *
 * This module is the arithmetic only, with no DOM in it, because that is the
 * part worth testing: jsdom reports every layout as zero, so a component test
 * cannot check the numbers.
