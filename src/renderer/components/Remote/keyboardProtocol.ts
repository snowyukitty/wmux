 * ordinary keys, whose encoding is fixed, and wrong for the ones wmux encodes
 * itself: `\x1b[13;2u` is the kitty form of Shift+Enter, and an app that never
 * asked for kitty reads it as ESC followed by `[13;2u` — in vim's insert mode
 * that leaves insert and runs the remainder as normal-mode input.
 *
 * xterm.js parses DECSET 2004 for us (`term.modes.bracketedPasteMode`) but
 * exposes nothing about keyboard protocols, so this watches the pane's own
 * output for the negotiations that matter. Same idea as the bracketed-paste
 * read, one layer lower.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative: unknown state means NOT negotiated, so the mirror
 * falls back to what xterm would have encoded — the behaviour before any of
 * this existed. A missed negotiation costs a convenience; a false positive
 * corrupts an editing session.
