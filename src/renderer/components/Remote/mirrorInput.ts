/**
 * Keyboard decisions for a remote-attach mirror.
 *
 * A mirror forwards keystrokes to a pane on another machine, so its default is
 * the opposite of a local pane's: every key belongs to the remote app, and
 * anything this side keeps is a deliberate exception. #895 is the list of
 * exceptions users noticed were missing — the editing conveniences that are not
 * the remote app's business at all, because the selection and the clipboard
 * they operate on are local.
 *
 * Only those. App shortcuts, terminal zoom, and custom keybindings still reach
 * the remote pane rather than being intercepted here; a mirror has no local
 * pane to act on, so stealing them would trade a working remote key for a
 * local no-op.
 *
 * Pure on purpose. The component owns the clipboard, the socket, and the
 * terminal; this file owns only the branching, so the table can be tested
 * without xterm, Electron, or a DOM — the same split `mirrorFit.ts` and
 * `newlineKeys.ts` already use.
