// How Moa's transcript reads as a conversation with its operator, applied
// after the purpose calls are lifted and the result events placed, before the
// shared Chat code groups rows:
//
// - One final report per job. A turn that closed its work (a successful
//   deck_complete_work) draws ONE report card where its final reply was: the
//   reply, what Moa checked, and each finished delegation's own report. The
//   completion call and the delegations' result events of that turn are not
//   drawn again on their own.
// - Only a turn's last reply is a message. Earlier prose in the same turn is
//   Moa narrating its steps ("Proposing the hand-off…"): it folds into the
//   activity with the tool rows, as thinking does.
