 * line named nothing, and in the expanded state its count restated what the
 * rows immediately below it already showed — it was redundant exactly when it
 * was most expensive. With eleven workspaces open the eleven lines were the
 * difference between seeing the list and scrolling it.
 *
 * The count moves onto the workspace row and the line goes away. What does NOT
 * move with it is a needs-you count: the workspace row's leading dot is
 * `selectWorkspaceAgentStatus`, the most-urgent status rolled up across the
 * whole workspace, so it already turns red when an agent here reaches
 * awaiting_input / waiting / error. That is the signal, and the row's scarcest
 * space should not render it twice.
 *
 * That reading was only true once #1168 closed. The dot's source,
 * `selectFleetPanes`, used to read neither `surfacePendingQuestion` — which
 * this roster promotes to awaiting_input — nor a stashed pane's `exited`
 * liveness, so a pane blocked on a question sat under a green dot while the
 * row right below it printed the question. Because the same roll-up drives
 * MiniSidebar, the titlebar vitals and the deck Fleet, the fix went in at the
 * source rather than behind a number that would only have corrected the
 * sidebar; that is still the reason not to add a second indicator here.
 *
 * Stash keeps its own glyph rather than a word — the same `IconEyeOff` the
 * expanded list's stash group header uses, so a collapsed workspace still
 * accounts for panes that are running but off-screen.
