// ─── Sidebar "Tasks" summary ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The sidebar is NAVIGATION ONLY (DESIGN.md Layout Contract). It used to render
// the full fan-out task list — title, status dot, `#` channel link, parent
// grouping, a finished-tasks disclosure — which is the exact same list the
// deck's ledger panel renders from the ledger, in a column that is not supposed
// to hold status at all. Two lists of the same tasks, in two colour grammars,
// on opposite edges of the window.
//
// What is left here is one line — how many tasks are open — and a click that
// takes you to the place that owns them: the workspace whose ledger holds
// them, the deck, its Agent tab. The per-task rows live in DeckLedgerPanel,
// which carries the `#` channel jump and the workspace jump those rows had, so
// no entry point was lost.
//
// It does NOT state "N need you". That fact already has its two permitted
// renditions (the titlebar vitals chip and the deck's red dots, DESIGN.md
// attention grammar), and a third one here would have had to be rolled up from
// the pane mirror while the deck rolls its dots up from the ledger — two
// derivations of one fact, free to disagree.
//
// With zero tasks it renders NOTHING (a "Tasks · 0 open" row is a dead gauge).
// When only finished tasks are left it says so, and the click opens the deck's
// finished disclosure — that is the only way back to a closed task's mission
// channel now.
//
// Lifetime (owner policy): a task counts only while its fan-out workspace is
// alive. When the workspace is gone the task goes with it, and the record stays
// in the mission channel (see selectLiveMissions).
