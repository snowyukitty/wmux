          enforceability gate beside it (see showsEnforcedModelBadge).

          IN THE FLOW, not absolutely positioned over the strip. It used to be
          an `position: absolute; right: <arithmetic past the action cluster>`
          badge owned by Pane.tsx, and that arithmetic knew only about the
          cluster, the zoom/maximize corner and the supervision badge — never
          about this toggle, which is a flow child sitting exactly where the
          offset landed. On a fan-out pane in Chat view the model pill covered
          the second toggle button outright, so the switch read "Terminal
          <model>" and the Chat label was only visible peeking out behind it.
          A wider constant would not have fixed it: the toggle's width is its
          two translated labels, so every locale moves the target. Laying the
          badge out as a sibling is what makes overlap unrepresentable.

          The supervision ⟳ badge above it moved here for the same reason and
          in the same change: it was the other absolute span parked over this
          corner, and with no role binding in play it covered the Chat button
          by itself. Both are labels, not controls, so neither takes pointer
          events away from anything — and being in the flow, both now keep
          their own hover tooltip, which `pointer-events: none` used to eat. */}
