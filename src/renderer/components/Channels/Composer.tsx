// `postMessageDaemon` thunk (U4, R4 + R11), which round-trips to the
// daemon via the `a2a.channel.post` RPC and applies the authoritative
// row through `postMessageOptimistic` on success. The synthesized
// `ChannelMessage` we construct here is the input shape — it is
// overwritten by the daemon's authoritative row in the slice.
//
// Failure surfacing: PERSIST_FAILED → push toast + show inline error.
// The slice never throws on failure; we branch on the structured
// `result.error.code` per R7 / the U2 maintainer directive.
