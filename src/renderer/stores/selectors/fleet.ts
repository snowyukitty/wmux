// store writes: Object.is holds when the winning task is unchanged, so the
// memoized FleetCard does not re-render on every a2a mutation — only when THIS
// pane's latest evidence task actually changes. The card derives the display
// counts from the returned task (see FleetCardEvidenceBadge).
//
// Addressing mirrors the selector's active-pane fidelity rule for `agentName`:
