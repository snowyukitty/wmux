// ─── Command Deck renderer state (Command Deck Phase 1, per-ws M1.5) ─────────
//
// The right-side dock is being re-framed from a pure "channel viewer" into a
// Command Deck: a tabbed surface whose DEFAULT tab (`commander`) is an
// LLM-less command composer — @-mention several agent panes at once and watch
// their replies land in one thread — and whose second tab (`channels`) holds
// the existing channel list + conversation exactly as before.
//
// This slice owns the deck's chrome state (which tab is active) and the
// Commander BRAIN threads. M1.5: one orchestrator per workspace → the brain
// conversation is a wsId-keyed map of independent threads, each with its own
// busy state. The deck shows the ACTIVE workspace's thread; a turn streaming
// in a background workspace keeps landing in ITS thread (events arrive
// enveloped with their workspaceId), so switching back shows the complete
// transcript — and the active workspace's composer is never blocked by
// another workspace's turn (the parallelism that motivated M1.5).
//
// Pattern mirrors the other thin UI slices (uiSlice's dock/panel toggles):
// enum fields + setters, no async, no bridge.
