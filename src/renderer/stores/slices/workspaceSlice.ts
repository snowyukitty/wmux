      //   updateSurfacePtyId(newId), but the store update did not
      //   reach Terminal before the user's first keystroke. That
      //   keystroke went to the old ptyId, which the daemon no
      //   longer had a SessionPipe for, and `pty.write` dropped it
      //   silently ("PTY_WRITE drop reason=no-live-session-pipe").
      //   Terminal looked alive (PTY init output flowed in) but was
      //   input-dead. The wipe pushed every surface into the
      //   well-tested Terminal.tsx self-create path, at the cost of
      //   silently breaking scrollback restore for v2.8.x-v2.9.0.
      //
      // FIX 0 CONTRACT (current):
      //   Saved ptyIds are preserved here. AppLayout owns the
      //   reconcile cycle: it gates PaneContainer mount on a
      //   generation-tokened, AbortController-cancellable reconcile
      //   pass that either matches each saved ptyId to a live
      //   daemon session (reconnect, scrollback preserved) or
      //   clears the ptyId (Terminal self-create on mount). By the
      //   time Terminal mounts, ptyId is final. The
      //   store→Pane→Terminal race is impossible because mount
      //   happens AFTER the gate resolves.
      //
      //   AppLayout's reconcile no longer fallback-creates
      //   replacement PTYs (the original race source). It only
      //   reconnects-or-clears. Fresh PTY creation is owned
      //   entirely by Terminal.tsx — the well-tested path stays
      //   well-tested.
      //
      //   On any reconcile failure (abort, timeout, RPC reject),
      //   AppLayout's catch calls store.clearAllPtyState(), which
      //   reproduces the historical wipe — but as an explicit,
      //   logged, generation-guarded fallback, not an unconditional
      //   startup behavior. The wipe lives there, not here.
      //
      //   Side state (floatingPanePtyId, terminalBookmarks,
      //   company member.ptyId) is also cleared by
      //   clearAllPtyState — see workspaceSlice.clearAllPtyState
