/**
 * Deterministic newline-key encoding for the terminal input path.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   xterm.js derives the bytes for Ctrl+<letter> from the *deprecated*
 *   `KeyboardEvent.keyCode` (it looks for keyCode 65-90 and emits
 *   `String.fromCharCode(keyCode - 64)`). Under a CJK IME (Microsoft Pinyin,
 *   Japanese, Korean, …) a keydown frequently reports `keyCode === 229`
 *   ("Process") and `key !== 'j'`, so xterm's branch never matches and
 *   Ctrl+J is silently dropped — no LF reaches the PTY. The user-visible
 *   symptom is "Ctrl+J newline sometimes fails" inside in-pane TUIs
 *   (codex, Claude Code): it works with the IME off and breaks with it on.
 *
 *   The rest of wmux already side-steps this by matching the *physical*
 *   `event.code` (see the split-shortcut allowlists in `useTerminal` and
 *   `useKeyboard`, added for Hangul/non-Latin layouts). This module applies
 *   the same approach to the newline keys so the encoding is deterministic
 *   regardless of IME state.
 *
 * Returned byte:
 *   - Shift+Enter → protocol-aware (see encodeShiftEnter): kitty CSI-u,
 *     win32-input-mode (`?9001h`, Codex on Windows — #1152), modifyOtherKeys,
 *     or LF when the local pane never negotiated. CSI-u without a kitty push
 *     is Escape + `[13;2u` to Claude Code inside wmux (TERM_PROGRAM=wmux is
 *     not on Claude's kitty whitelist), which is why Shift+Enter submitted
 *     after #1228 (#1152 follow-up). LF is the same byte Ctrl+J already sends.
 *   - Native Windows Codex → Alt+Enter (`ESC CR`) for all three keys (see
 *     `altEnterNewline`, #1694).
 *   - Ctrl+Enter → LF (`\n`): same intent as Ctrl+J. With no extended keyboard
 *     protocol enabled, xterm sends a bare CR for Ctrl+Enter — byte-identical
 *     to plain Enter — so an in-pane TUI submits instead of inserting a
 *     newline. Many users reach for Ctrl+Enter expecting a newline; we emit LF
 *     so it behaves like Ctrl+J / Shift+Enter.
 *   - Ctrl+J → LF (`\n`, U+000A): the canonical "insert newline, do not
 *     submit" byte that codex / Claude Code / readline editors expect. This
 *     is exactly what xterm would emit in its legacy path — we just emit it
 *     ourselves so an IME can't suppress it.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the event is not a deterministic newline key (or when a
 * guard declines to take it over), in which case the caller defers to xterm's
 * normal handling.
