/**
 * The ONE definition of the Rich Input chord (⌘G on macOS, Ctrl+G elsewhere).
 *
 * Two gates have to agree about this key, and #1280 is what their
 * disagreement costs:
 *
 *   • `useTerminal`'s xterm key handler decides whether the pane gets a byte.
 *   • `useComposeShortcut` (a document-level listener) decides whether the
 *     Rich Input popover opens.
 *
 * xterm's own encode path calls `stopPropagation` (its `cancel()`), so the
 * pane gate runs FIRST and the popover gate only ever sees keys the pane gate
 * let bubble. Any condition one gate applies and the other cannot see produces
 * a silently dead key: swallowed by the pane, declined by the popover. That is
 * exactly how the loose matcher shipped — the popover gate accepted
 * Ctrl+Shift+G (`key` is 'G' precisely when Shift is held) while the pane gate
 * was still writing BEL for plain Ctrl+G.
 *
 * So the chord is a pure predicate, exported, and both gates call it. It can
 * be wrong, but it cannot be inconsistent.
 *
 * What the predicate deliberately excludes:
 *
 *   • `isComposing` — every other control-letter path in the renderer defers
 *     during an IME composition (`resolveCtrlLetterByte`, `resolveNewlineKeyByte`,
 *     the IME-Escape branch). Without it a Hangul preedit plus the physical
 *     `KeyG` fallback below popped Rich Input mid-composition. Deferring hands
 *     the key to xterm, which drops keyCode-229 keydowns — the same no-op every
 *     other ctrl-letter already has while composing.
 *   • Shift and Alt — Ctrl+Shift+G is `clearMultiview`, and Ctrl+Alt+G /
 *     Ctrl+Meta+G are nobody's binding, so they must keep reaching the pane.
 *
 * What it deliberately INCLUDES:
 *
 *   • `key === 'G'` with Shift up, which happens under Caps Lock.
 *   • The physical `code` fallback, for a Hangul / non-Latin layout where
 *     `key` is a composed jamo or 'Process' (mirrors the Ctrl+C / Ctrl+J
 *     handlers in useTerminal).
 *   • Auto-repeat. Holding the chord is still the chord: the popover gate
 *     declines to TOGGLE on a repeat (flapping it open and shut is not what
 *     the user asked for), but both gates agree the key belongs to the
 *     binding, so a held Ctrl+G produces one toggle and then nothing —
 *     a non-repeating chord — instead of a stream of BEL.

 * or wherever the user moved it, or nothing when they switched it off), found
 * by the one resolver every keyboard gate shares. That resolver already
 * carries the rules this predicate used to own — exact modifiers (so

/**
 * Ownership, the other half of #1280 — and the half the first fix only wired
 * into ONE of the two gates.
 *
 * `useComposeShortcut` toggles Rich Input for the workspace's ACTIVE LEAF pty,
 * because that is the pane whose toolbar renders the popover. So only that
 * pane's terminal may fire the chord. Give the key to any other xterm and the
 * popover opens over the wrong pane: the live dogfood on the floating pane
 * (Cmd+` / Ctrl+`) hit exactly that — its own pty received 0 bytes while the
 * popover opened on a background pane, which on Windows is the original
 * complaint (`^G` in the floating pane AND a popover elsewhere).
 *
 * `useTerminal` stamps every terminal container with its ptyId, and adds the
 * owner marker only where `ownsComposeShortcut` is set (Terminal.tsx, the
 * pane-surface terminal — not FloatingPane, not Deck's BrainTerminalEmbed).
 * Both gates then read ownership from the same marker instead of each holding
 * an opinion.
