// Global terminal output scheduler — one cooperative drain loop for ALL panes.
//
// RCA (2026-07-10 multi-workspace stutter): every workspace's pane tree stays
// mounted (tmux-style persistence), and useTerminal wrote PTY data straight
// into each pane's xterm on every IPC event. xterm's internal WriteBuffer
// schedules parse/render callbacks PER TERMINAL, so N busy hidden agents run
// N independent write pipelines on the shared renderer thread and the focused
// pane's input echo and paint starve between them. Repaint-side work (#333)
// cannot fix this — the contention is in the write/parse path.
//
// This module serializes all pane writes through a single budgeted drain:
//
//   - Visible pane, empty queue, bounded chunk → DIRECT write (byte-identical
//     to the old path; the focused pane pays zero added latency in steady
//     state).
//   - Visible pane, queued bytes OR one oversized chunk → enqueue as priority
//     + drain(0), so per-terminal byte order is never violated AND a visible
//     pane's OWN output flood (e.g. the agent you are watching printing a
//     torrent) is chunked under the drain budget instead of blocking the
//     renderer in a single parse.
//   - Hidden pane → enqueue; drained in the background cadence.
//   - Drain tick: at most MAX_WRITES_PER_DRAIN hand-offs of CHUNK_CHARS each
//     under a hard DRAIN_TIME_BUDGET_MS wall-clock budget, priority entries
//     first, round-robin across terminals.
//
// NOTHING is ever dropped. On overflow (a hidden pane flooding past
// MAX_QUEUE_CHARS) the queue is flushed straight into xterm — that is exactly
// the pre-scheduler behavior, so the worst case degrades to the old baseline
// instead of losing output. (A lossy cap needs a main-side screen mirror to
// rehydrate from; that is a separate, later stage.)
//
// Phase 3 (hidden-pane retention, opt-in via WriteOptions.retainWhenHidden):
// the batching above still PARSES every hidden byte eventually, which is the
// measured bottleneck (hiddenFlood bench: 4 hidden flooders drag the visible
// pane to 8-20fps even with batching). Retention mode changes the hidden
// policy to "queue but never drain" — the renderer parses nothing for hidden
// panes. On overflow the backlog is discarded and the terminal marked DIRTY;
// dirtiness is the caller's signal to re-synchronize the full screen state
// from the source of truth (the daemon session's RingBuffer) on reveal or
// before a buffer read. This is safe precisely because daemon sessions retain
// the authoritative bytes — which is why the option is only set for
// daemon-backed panes (see useTerminal).
