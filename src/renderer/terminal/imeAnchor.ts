/**
 * IME candidate-window anchoring (#874).
 *
 * Windows CJK IMEs draw their candidate window at the caret rect Chromium
 * reports for the focused editable element. In a terminal that element is
 * xterm's hidden helper textarea, so wherever xterm parks the textarea is
 * where the candidate list appears. xterm parks it in the wrong place, twice
 * over:
 *
 *   1. Wrong row while the viewport is scrolled up. `_syncTextArea` anchors at
 *      `buffer.y * cellHeight`, which is ybase-relative, but the renderer
 *      paints the cursor at `(ybase + y) - ydisp` (WebglRenderer.ts:402), which
 *      is ydisp-relative. The two disagree by exactly the number of rows the
 *      viewport is scrolled up. xterm's own guard `isCursorInViewport`
 *      (Buffer.ts:97) applies the ydisp term correctly, and InputHandler.ts:502
 *      converts with `+ (ybase - ydisp)` and a comment explaining why, so the
 *      anchor code is simply missing it. Measured live: ybase=22, ydisp=14,
 *      cursorY=38, cellHeight=17.6 -> anchor row 38, painted row 46, drift -8.
 *      wmux runs with `scrollOnUserInput: false`, so unlike stock xterm the
 *      drift does not self-heal when the user types — one stray wheel scroll
 *      leaves the candidate window misaligned until the user scrolls back.
 *
 *   2. Moving target while composing. `CompositionHelper.updateCompositionElements`
 *      re-anchors on every `compositionupdate` (plus a recursive setTimeout),
 *      so while an agent streams output the candidate window chases wherever
 *      the TUI last parked the cursor mid-redraw. Latin input shows no
 *      candidate window, which is why only CJK users see it.
 *
 * And a third cause lives in the anchor's input rather than its math
 * (field-verified on v3.42.0 after the first two were fixed): the buffer
 * cursor sampled at `compositionstart` is not always the input caret. A TUI
 * like Claude Code repaints its lower region every frame, and while a frame's
 * escape stream is being parsed the cursor rides along with the writes — it is
 * only parked back on the caret by the cursor-positioning sequence at the end
 * of the frame. Frames arrive from the PTY split across chunks, so there are
 * real JS turns where the cursor sits mid-frame, and a composition starting in
 * one of them freezes a wrong-but-stable anchor:
 *
 *   PTY frame (one TUI repaint, split across N chunks):
 *
 *    chunk1        chunk2        chunk3(final: CUP to caret)
 *    ├─parse─┤gap├─parse─┤gap├─parse─┤───────── rest ─────────┤ next frame
 *    cursor:  mid-frame    mid-frame  caret     caret (holds)
 *             (transient)  (transient)
 *    gap  = inter-chunk, sub-ms to a few ms
 *    rest = inter-frame, >= ~50 ms streaming, seconds when idle
 *
 *    compositionstart in a "gap"  -> samples a transient   <- the bug
 *    compositionstart in "rest"   -> samples the caret
 *
 * The countermeasure is a resting-cell tracker: the anchor freezes to the last
 * cell the cursor held for at least RESTING_MS when the instantaneous cursor
 * is inside a move burst. Known limit, accepted deliberately: dwell time
 * cannot distinguish the caret from any cell the cursor parks on for
 * >= RESTING_MS, so the compositionstart diagnostic reports which source was
 * selected and why — the field log is the discriminator before any further
 * complexity is added.
 *
 * That limit is exactly what #951 hit (field logs, WeChat IME + Microsoft
 * Pinyin, Claude Code streaming into a 128x45 pane): `src=instant` selections
 * at (127,43), (53,43), (127,38) — screen corners and output rows, never the
 * user's input line. While an agent streams, output arrives in bursts with
 * inter-burst gaps far above RESTING_MS (token pacing, network), and between
 * bursts the cursor sits wherever the last write left it. Dwell time
 * certifies that parked cursor as "at rest"; the resting fallback is derived
 * from the same buffer cursor and is just as blind. The missing signal is
 * output recency: a cell the cursor held through a period with NO parsed PTY
 * output is where the TUI deliberately parked it — the caret at rest — while
 * any cursor position observed with output still flowing is repaint state.
 * So the tracker also records the last "quiet caret": the cell the cursor
 * held across the most recent >= OUTPUT_QUIET_MS output-free span, stored
 * ybase-RELATIVE (screen row), because a TUI addresses its input line by
 * screen position and scrolling output changes that line's absolute row while
 * its screen row stays put. A composition starting while output is recent
 * AND has been flowing for STREAM_SUSTAIN_MS anchors there (`src=caret`)
 * instead of trusting dwell. The sustain gate is what keeps the quiet-shell
 * typing flow intact: a committed syllable's echo is also "recent output",
 * but it is an isolated burst — without the gate, every commit would push
 * the next composition onto the stale snapshot instead of the correctly
 * advanced cursor, and a fluid typist's candidate window would drift further
 * from the caret with every word (3-model panel finding on the first cut).
 * Dwell has one more blind spot even when quiet (#953 field cases 1-3): a
 * TUI with nothing to point at — empty input box, mid-edit redraw — parks
 * its real cursor at the LAST column of the line it painted, and a long gap
 * then certifies that placeholder. A CJK composition can never sit on the
 * last column (the glyph alone is two cells wide), so such a selection is
 * FLAGGED (`edge=1` in the diagnostic), and while output is FLOWING it also
 * defers to the quiet-caret snapshot; while output is quiet the selection is
 * NOT rerouted. Such a cell is also refused as a snapshot, so a quiet span
 * that finds the TUI parked at the line end keeps the caret the last real one
 * recorded instead of replacing it — without that, deferring to the snapshot
 * just moves the same wrong cell one step earlier.
 * That last split is the whole lesson of three earlier generations, all of
 * which rerouted a line-end park in every condition and all of which lost to
 * the untouched baseline: re-selecting the quiet snapshot wandered between
 * inputs (an idle TUI keeps twitching its cursor, so consecutive quiet spans
 * certify different cells); reusing the previous composition's anchor locked
 * whatever error the first anchor had for the whole session; and withholding
 * line-end cells from the snapshot measured worse too. What they had in
 * common was acting while the pane was IDLE, which is exactly where dwell was
 * already right. The streaming half was still broken after they were reverted
 * (#953 field log, 2026-08-21: `gap=203ms caretAge=602ms src=instant edge=1`
 * — a usable snapshot passed over, candidate window pinned to the pane's
 * bottom-right corner), so the rule now fires only when output arrived within
 * OUTPUT_QUIET_MS. The idle line-end miss stays a KNOWN, flagged residual.
 * The 2026-08-23 field round (#953, final report) then showed the snapshot
 * side of the same shape: the SNAPSHOT is sometimes the park, and a park is
 * "wherever the painted text ended", which can be any column at all — the
 * log holds snapshots at column 137 of a 139-column pane and at column 53
 * mid-line — so the last-column refusal only catches a painted line that
 * happens to fill the row. Underneath both: while an agent streams, its
 * cursor never visits the input caret at all — the ecosystem contract says
 * the TUI must park its cursor on the caret (Ink's useCursor exists; Claude
 * Code has not shipped it, see anthropics/claude-code#25186) — so no
 * cursor-derived rule, in any combination, can find the caret mid-stream.
 * That is why the streaming anchor has a second signal class (#1016): at
 * compositionstart, when the pane's agent is recognized and output is
 * flowing, the input line is read out of the buffer by its chrome
 * (scanClaudeInputLine) and outranks every cursor source (`src=marker`).
 * The cursor path remains for unrecognized agents, for a scan that finds
 * nothing, and for the idle pane, which stays cursor-driven on purpose —
 * idle is field-verified correct and every generation that touched it lost.
 * Known residuals, all identifiable in a field log via the src/gap/
 * caretAge/edge fields: the line-end park above; a mid-stream pause longer
 * than OUTPUT_QUIET_MS with the cursor parked mid-line on repaint state
 * re-snapshots a wrong caret; a resize or clear mid-stream drops (resize)
 * or strands (clear — no reset event fires) the snapshot until output next
 * goes quiet; and a caret deliberately moved by the very chunk that ends a
 * quiet span is snapshotted at its pre-move cell.
 *
 * All of this lives in upstream xterm and this repo does not patch
 * node_modules, so the correction is applied downstream as a `transform` that
 * composes with the `style.top` / `style.left` xterm keeps writing, instead of
 * fighting it. #875 put that transform on the `.xterm-helpers` container;
 * #942 showed the container is the wrong unit, because its two children have
 * opposite requirements while a composition is live:
 *
 *   .xterm-screen  (position: relative, origin for everything below)
 *     +-- .xterm-helpers
 *     |     +-- textarea            <- style.top/left [xterm] + transform [ours: pinned]
 *     |     +-- .composition-view   <- style.top/left [xterm] + transform [ours: live]
 *     +-- canvas                    <- painted cursor                     [webgl]
 *
 * The textarea is what Chromium reports the caret rect from, so it is what a
 * floating candidate window (Chinese/Japanese) follows — pinning it for the
 * whole composition is the point of the freeze. The `.composition-view` is
 * the visible inline preedit, and `CompositionHelper.updateCompositionElements`
 * deliberately re-anchors it to the live cursor on every `compositionupdate`.
 * Korean Microsoft IME draws no candidate window at all: the preedit rendered
 * inline at the caret IS the text the user is watching. Freezing the shared
 * parent turned every committed syllable's echo into a backwards drag — the
 * caret advances past the pinned point, `frozen - actual` goes negative, and
 * the composing syllable is painted on top of the one that just committed
 * (typing 대한민국 reads 대한국, #942). The composition ending cleared the
 * transform and the WebGL repaint restored the real cells, which is why the
 * buffer was never wrong, only the paint. So the pin applies to the textarea
 * alone, and the preedit gets the same anchor math against the live cursor —
 * applied at xterm's own composition-event cadence (not per render frame, see
 * syncPreedit) so it lands on the painted caret when the viewport is scrolled
 * (cause 1 applies to it too) without chasing mid-repaint transient cursors.
 * One exception (#951 field report on the first quiet-caret build): when the
 * freeze cell came from the quiet caret and the live cursor sits on some
 * OTHER screen row — the streaming agent's repaint cursor — the preedit pins
 * to the same frozen point as the textarea; otherwise the pinyin rides the
 * agent's output rows while its candidate list sits at the input line, and
 * the two IME surfaces tear apart. The exception is row-gated (#1032, the
 * first ship of it was not): fluid Korean typing reaches the streaming
 * branch too — each committed syllable's echo is output, and sub-quiet gaps
 * sustain the epoch — and there the live cursor IS the caret advancing along
 * the anchor's own row while the snapshot's column is one quiet-span stale.
 * Pinning the preedit there repainted the composing syllable over text
 * already committed (typing 정확히 어떻 read 떻확히 어) — the very drag #945
 * removed, reintroduced on the new path. A same-row cursor is the caret; a
 * cross-row cursor is repaint state (see preeditFollowsLiveCursor).
 *
 * Timing note, learned from the #1032 field log: xterm positions the preedit
 * ONLY in `updateCompositionElements`, which it calls from `compositionupdate`.
 * Its `compositionstart` handler sets `textContent = ''` and the `active`
 * class and nothing else, so at start the element still carries the PREVIOUS
 * composition's `style.left/top`. Correcting against those produced a
 * start-record `preedit` offset that recurred identically across unrelated
 * compositions — inert on screen (an empty view has no padding or min-width,
 * so it is zero-width until the first update fills it) but indistinguishable
 * in a log from a real drag, which defeats the point of a diagnostic that
 * exists to be read by reporters. The preedit correction therefore begins at
 * the first update, where the position is real.
 *
 * The correction is computed as `desired - actual`, where `actual` is read back
 * from the styles xterm wrote rather than re-derived from the buffer. That
 * matters for three reasons: `_syncTextArea` early-returns while composing (so
 * a buffer-derived estimate would be wrong exactly when it counts), xterm stops
 * syncing entirely once the cursor leaves the viewport (leaving stale
 * coordinates a model cannot predict), and if a future xterm release fixes the
 * anchor upstream then `desired - actual` collapses to zero on its own instead
 * of double-correcting.

/**
 * Whether the inline preedit keeps following the live cursor for a
 * composition whose textarea pin came from the streaming branch (#1032).
 *
 * `caret`/`marker` freeze cells answer a line-level question — which row the
 * agent's input line is on — with a column that can be one quiet-span stale.
 * The inline preedit needs the character-level answer: where in that line the
 * user is NOW. The live cursor gives that answer exactly when it sits on the
 * anchor's own screen row (commit echoes advance it along the input line —
 * the field-clean v3.46.0 behavior for Korean), and is repaint state when it
 * sits anywhere else (#951: screen corners, output rows — following it there
 * tears the preedit away from the candidate window). Rows are compared
 * screen-relative, like the caret snapshot itself: streaming output scrolls
 * the buffer under the input line while its screen row stays put.
 *
 * The gate is a row RANGE, not a single row: a `marker` anchor knows the
 * box's interior height, and wrapped input puts the caret on a continuation
 * row that is still the user's caret (#1032 review finding — without the
 * span, multi-line messages kept exactly the drag this gate exists to
 * remove). Cursor-derived anchors have no box knowledge and keep a span
 * of 1.
 *
 * Known, accepted residual (3-way review consensus): an agent repaint that
 * PARKS inside this row range — the #953 line-end park landing on a box
 * row — reads as the caret, and the preedit follows it until the next
 * composition event. Every prior generation that tried to outsmart a park
 * (column heuristics, hysteresis, reroutes) field-tested worse than
 * leaving it alone (see the header history), and for Korean a same-row
 * follow is exactly the field-clean v3.46.0 behavior. The diagnostic's
 * pin/preedit pair discriminates it in a field log.

   * is one quiet-span stale, and pinning to it painted the composing syllable
   * over committed text (the very drag #945 removed, reintroduced on the new
   * path). The row test is preeditFollowsLiveCursor, evaluated per
   * composition event, so a cursor that leaves the row mid-composition (an
   * agent chunk landing between keystrokes) pins for that event and resumes
   * following when it returns. The quiet case is untouched: there the
   * selection is instant/resting and the live follow stays (#942 stays
   * fixed).
   *
   * Deliberately called only from the composition handlers, NOT from
   * onRender/onScroll: at a composition event xterm has just written the
   * preedit's styles from the same instantaneous cursor this reads, so the
   * correction reduces to the ydisp term and the preedit's motion profile
   * stays exactly stock xterm's. Following the cursor per render frame would
   * re-open the cause-3 hole for the preedit — an agent streaming into the
   * pane parks the cursor mid-repaint on real JS turns, and a per-frame
   * follow would drag the composing syllable around the screen (2-model
   * panel finding on the first cut of this fix).
