// Wake-boundary glyph-atlas recovery — the corruption class atlasGuard's poll
// cannot see.
//
// atlasGuard (#741) watches the shared atlas's PAGE STRUCTURES (count, fill)
// and repairs the page-merge corruption class. But macOS sleep→wake can trash
// the atlas's TEXTURE CONTENT on the GPU without firing webglcontextlost and
// without touching any page structure the poll reads: every pane then samples
// garbage pixels for perfectly consistent-looking pages, and no existing
// repair path fires (refresh() re-rasters from the same corrupted texture;
// PREVENT/CURE see nothing wrong). Observed in the field on v3.38.4, which
// already ships #741 — this module covers the residual class.
//
// Strategy (boundary-driven rebuild, adapted from Orca's wake-recovery design
// — idea only, no code imported; github.com/stablyai/orca,
// use-terminal-window-wake-recovery.ts): at the moments GPU state is suspect,
// unconditionally rebuild the shared atlas via atlasGuard.recoverNow — the
// same coherent clear+refresh-all PREVENT/CURE performs, so the #191
// stale-sibling hazard cannot occur.
//
// Triggers:
//   - system resume  — main's powerMonitor 'resume' over IPC. The decisive
//                      signal: texture memory is invalidated by sleep.
//   - visibility     — document became visible again. Backstop for the
//                      unlock-screen gap where the resume event can land
//                      while the window is still hidden and Chromium may
//                      re-jig GPU memory before first present.
//
// Window FOCUS is deliberately NOT a trigger: plain refocus (alt-tab) is
// frequent and often lands mid-stream, and wiping the shared atlas while
// output is flowing re-arms xterm's page-merge race (xterm.js #4480) — the
// same reason glyphRepaint's focus path never touches the atlas.
//
// The two triggers routinely fire together on a real wake; the throttle
// collapses them into one rebuild.
//
//   - context restored — a pane's WebGL canvas fired `webglcontextrestored`.
//                        A GPU-process crash/reset blanks the GPU-backed 2D
//                        canvases that hold the shared atlas's PAGES, while
//                        the atlas's glyph cache still points into them.
//                        xterm's own restore handler rebuilds only its GL
//                        objects, re-uploads the now-empty pages, and every
//                        cached glyph renders blank; only glyphs rasterised
//                        after the crash show up. Its onContextLoss (our DOM
//                        fallback) fires only when the context is NOT
//                        restored within 3 s, so a quick restore had no
//                        repair at all. Reproduced live with CDP
//                        `Browser.crashGpuProcess` (a synthetic
//                        WEBGL_lose_context round-trip does not blank the
//                        2D pages and renders clean). The event does not
//                        bubble, so it is caught in the capture phase — which
//                        runs BEFORE xterm's target-phase handler — and the
//                        rebuild is deferred past it and debounced, since
//                        every pane restores in the same burst.
//
// THE VISIBILITY TRIGGER IS LATCHED BY RESUME, NOT FIRED ON ITS OWN (#1234).
//
// A previous measurement on Electron 41 concluded that Windows never fires
// `visibilitychange` while the window is covered or minimized, and the trigger
// above was written on that assumption — a harmless macOS-only backstop. The
// #1234 field log falsifies it: on Windows 10.0.19045 the renderer logged
// `recover (visibility)` 18 times in 15 minutes of ordinary alt-tabbing, 12 of
// them 13-26 ms after a `[wmux:glyph-repaint] focus`. (The reason string
// `visibility` can only be produced here, so the trigger firing is proven, not
// inferred.) Chromium's native window occlusion does flip `visibilityState` on
// that build, so on Windows the visibility trigger IS the window-focus trigger
// — the one trigger this module deliberately refuses to have, because wiping
// the shared atlas while output is flowing re-arms xterm's page-merge race (11
// of those 18 wipes landed within 1 s of a live output burst).
//
// So visibility alone no longer recovers. Its stated job is narrow: cover the
// unlock-screen gap where main's `resume` lands while the window is still
// hidden, i.e. where the rebuild it triggers can be undone by Chromium before
// first present. That is a ONE-SHOT LATCH, not a time window: a resume that
// arrives while the window is hidden arms exactly one visibility recovery,
// which fires on the next transition to visible and clears the latch. A time
// window would be wrong in both directions — unlock takes as long as the user
// takes to type a password (a 10 s window expires and the invalidated atlas
// stays broken until the next sleep, since the poll cannot see wake
// corruption), while any window at all leaves every alt-tab inside it firing a
// wipe. The latch is also exempt from the throttle below, so a fast unlock is
// not swallowed by the rebuild the resume itself just performed.
//
// A resume that arrives while the window is already VISIBLE does not arm the
// latch: its own rebuild is effective, and arming would only add a second wipe
// on the `visibilitychange` that may follow milliseconds later — exactly what
// the throttle was introduced to collapse.
//
// WHERE THE LATCH IS REQUIRED, AND WHY IT IS PLATFORM-SCOPED.
//
// Electron's `powerMonitor` 'resume' exists as an API everywhere but is not
// reliably emitted on some Linux session setups, and on such a machine
// visibility is the only wake backstop there is. So the latch is required only
// where the resume signal is trustworthy:
//
//   win32 / darwin — required IMMEDIATELY. `powerMonitor` resume is dependable
//                    on both, and on Windows we have field evidence
//                    (#1234) that visibility fires on an ordinary alt-tab, so
//                    an unarmed visibility change is known to be noise.
//   linux          — keeps the pre-#1234 unconditional behaviour until a resume
//                    has actually been DELIVERED once. That first delivery
//                    proves the signal works on this machine and the latch is
//                    required from then on. The cost is one unjustified wipe
//                    per visibility change until its first sleep, accepted in
//                    exchange for never leaving a platform with no wake
//                    recovery at all.
//
// A first draft gated purely on first delivery, on every platform. Live dogfood
// killed it: it left #1234 UNFIXED on the reporter's machine until that machine
// happened to sleep once, and their report is 15 minutes of alt-tabbing with no
// reason to think it ever slept. A bug fix that waits for a suspend to take
// effect is not a fix.
//
// The rejected alternative was to stop trusting the event and detect the wake
// directly — compare wall-clock elapsed against expected elapsed and treat a
// large unexplained jump as a sleep. It is the more honest signal in principle
// and would cover Linux too, but its discriminator is unsound in exactly the
// state it has to work in: a hidden renderer has its timers throttled (and can
// have them frozen outright), so an ordinary alt-tab away produces the same
// unexplained wall-clock jump as a real suspend and would re-arm the wipe on
// every app switch — the bug this module is fixing. The monotonic-clock variant
// trades that for a different unknown, since whether the monotonic clock
// advances across suspend differs by platform; if it pauses, the jump never
// appears and wake recovery dies silently everywhere. A platform gate rests on
// something we have actually measured.
//
// Anything that needs to know whether the window can be seen must still ask
// main instead of reading `visibilityState` (see main/window/windowDisplayed.ts,
// which is how the #766 viewer-visibility report gets its answer since #882) —
// that path is right on every platform, whereas `visibilityState` is only
// occlusion-driven, as this issue's log shows.
