/**
 * Resting-cursor guard for synchronized-output frame writers (#929).
 *
 * Codex (and TUIs of its shape) repaint through `?2026` synchronized-output
 * frames, but some frames — status-line ticks, the "Working" shimmer — END
 * with the hardware cursor parked wherever the frame's last text write
 * finished: after the model/cwd status text, next to the spinner. The frame is
 * complete (`?2026l`, cursor visible), so honoring `?2026` does not help; a
 * faithful renderer briefly paints the cursor there. Byte-timestamped capture
 * shows those states holding 17–23 ms on a fast machine and a full video
 * frame (≥42 ms) on the reporter's — quasi-periodic flashes that read as a
 * second blinking caret (upstream: openai/codex#9081, #32546).
 *
 * The guard renders the cursor only at REST: every chunk that carries a
 * `?2026` marker gets `?25l` appended, and the cursor is re-shown only after
 * RESTING_DELAY_MS with no further frame traffic — and only if the
 * application itself last asked for a visible cursor (its own DECTCEM state
 * is tracked and never overridden at rest). Measured over a real codex
 * session, this cuts stray-position cursor visibility by ~93% while the
 * composer caret keeps its resting visibility.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately behavioral, not per-agent: only chunks containing
 * `?2026` arm the guard, so classic TUIs that never bracket frames (vim,
 * less, htop) are untouched — their cursor keeps xterm's default behavior.
 * 32 ms matches the ImeAnchor resting threshold (#888), the same "the cursor's
 * resting cell is the truthful one" reading applied to rendering.
