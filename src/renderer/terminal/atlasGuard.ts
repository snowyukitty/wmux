// Shared-atlas page-merge guard for the "scattered wrong glyph" corruption
// class (reported 2026-08-01; see TODOS.md).
//
// Root cause (verified against @xterm/addon-webgl 0.19 internals): the WebGL
// glyph texture atlas is SHARED across every same-config terminal
// (acquireTextureAtlas keeps a module-level cache with an ownedBy list). The
// atlas caps its page pool at `TextureAtlas.maxAtlasPages =
// min(32, MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS)` — 16 on Apple Silicon. When the pool is
// full, `_createNewPage()` MERGES four pages into one and DELETES the
// originals, rewriting every affected glyph's texturePage index and shifting
// the indices of the pages behind them. Renderers of OTHER panes sharing the
// atlas keep cached vertex data pointing at the old indices and sample the
// wrong page: scattered wrong glyphs, across several panes at once, that
// plain refresh()/resize cannot repair (the stale cache entries survive a
// re-raster). Opening a new pane fixed it only because its mount recreates a
// WebGL addon and rebuilds the shared atlas from scratch.
//
// CJK is the trigger workload: Hangul alone has 11,172 distinct syllables, so
// Korean-heavy sessions mint new glyphs continuously and are the realistic
// way to exhaust 16 pages.
//
// Strategy — the patched addon (I1–I4) is the happy path. This guard is a
// backstop for unpatched / old addons, and for a merge that still slips
// through:
//
//   PREVENT  Unpatched addon only. When a shared atlas's page count
//            approaches the merge trigger (trigger − GUARD_MARGIN_PAGES) AND
//            that many pages are actually OCCUPIED (a long pool of empty
//            pages is nowhere near a merge — see defect 2 below), clear the
//            atlas (clearTexture empties every page in place and clears both
//            cache maps) and then drop the render model of every pane sharing
//            it, in the same tick. That is the coherent all-owners rebuild
//            upstream itself performs on font changes — the #191 hazard was
//            clearing from ONE pane while its siblings kept stale references,
//            which this never does. Speculative firings are rate-limited
//            (GUARD_PREVENT_COOLDOWN_MS); a saturated pool re-arms the gate
//            every poll and the rebuild is not free.
//
//            A coherent atlas duck-types via optional `clearModelGeneration`
//            and self-evicts at the sampler budget (I2). PREVENT never fires
//            on that shape — wiping it every 30s would fight the atlas.
//
//   CURE     If a merge slips through anyway, do the same clear+rebuild-all,
//            with no rate limit. Corruption is visible for at most one poll
//            interval instead of indefinitely.
//
//            A coherent atlas that wipes or merges itself bumps
//            `clearModelGeneration`, and that collapse also reads as
//            count-drop / page-identity / page-removed to this poll. The
//            generation advance used to consume the latch and skip, trusting
//            the patched addon (I3) to rebuild its owners. It does not hold
//            under CJK load — a Hangul flood self-evicts every ~2s and paints
//            scrambled glyphs with the guard silent — so a generation advance
//            now runs the same coherent rebuild, once per bump, no cooldown.
//            Unpatched addons omit the field and still get every CURE.
//
//            Three signals feed it, strongest first — a page-removal EVENT, a
//            page-count drop, and a page-identity change. Count alone is not
//            enough, and the trigger workload walks straight into its blind
//            spot. Read the real arity off `_createNewPage`: on the merge path
//            it deletes the 4 selected pages, pushes the merged one, and then
//            falls through to push the fresh page it was called for — delete 4,
//            add 2, a net −2. So a count drop is only visible while the pool
//            stays shrunk, and the very output burst that causes the merge
//            re-allocates those 2 pages well inside one 2s poll: the count is
//            back where it started and CURE never fires.
//
//            Page identity closes that gap without replacing the count check —
//            growth only ever APPENDS, so every previously seen index must
//            still hold the SAME page object, and a changed slot means pages
//            were deleted and re-created. Count-drop remains supported, and is
//            the fallback whenever pages cannot carry an identity tag.
//
//            Neither polled signal can see a merge confined to pages BORN AND
//            DESTROYED between two samples (raised in review on #790), so the
//            guard also subscribes to upstream's page-removal event and
//            prefers it. Verified against the installed @xterm/addon-webgl
//            0.19.0: `_onRemoveTextureAtlasCanvas.fire` has exactly ONE call
//            site, inside `_mergePages` (TextureAtlas.ts:224) — which only
//            `_createNewPage`'s merge branch calls — so the event cannot mean
//            anything but a merge. It fires once per consumed page, just
//            before the deletes, making it an exact real-time signal with no
//            sampling gap.
//
// Three independent defects made that repair fire 4657 times in one day and
// achieve nothing — then, once (1) and (2) were fixed, made it start causing
// the very corruption it was written to repair. All three are fixed here.
//
//   1. The clear did not clear. Upstream `clearTexture()` short-circuits on a
//      page-0-only "already clean" probe, and page 0 is exactly the page that
//      stays empty once refill resumes from the tail — so it became a permanent
//      no-op. `clearAtlasTexture` below defeats that probe and VERIFIES the
//      postcondition instead of assuming it.
//
//   2. The gate measured the wrong thing. PREVENT asked "is the LAST page in
//      use", but allocation resumes from `_activePages[length - 1]`, so one
//      glyph after a clear re-arms it immediately — there is no anti-thrash
//      property in that condition at all, whether or not the clear works. It
//      now measures OCCUPANCY (`used >= preventAt`), which is what actually
//      predicts a merge: upstream only merges from `_createNewPage`, and a new
//      page is only created when a glyph fits in no existing page. Measured in
//      the field at the moment of a PREVENT storm: 15 pages, 1 in use — every
//      one of those firings was spurious.
//
//   3. The rebuild wiped the atlas but left every pane's render model intact,
//      so `refresh()` skipped every unchanged cell and kept its old glyph
//      coordinates into a pool that had just been emptied and re-packed. That
//      IS the corruption. It was invisible while (1) made the clear a no-op;
//      fixing (1) armed it. Field log, v3.38.7 on 2026-08-05 KST (the lines
//      themselves are UTC, `2026-08-04T20:40-20:41Z`): nine
//      `prevent … clear=cleared` events in the 90s before a corrupted-Hangul
//      screenshot, zero merge cures — the merge path never ran. See
//      `clearRenderModel` for the upstream pairing this now reproduces.
//
// Fixing (1) alone was worse than shipping neither, in both directions: the
// no-op loop became a real full-atlas wipe plus an all-pane re-raster every
// two seconds, and each of those wipes desynced the panes it was meant to
// repair.
//
// Internal-field dependency: reaching the atlas needs `addon._renderer
// ._charAtlas` (same accepted trade-off as webglTeardown.ts's `_renderer._gl`)
// — every access is optional-chained, so if upstream reshapes its internals
// the guard degrades to a silent no-op, never a crash.
