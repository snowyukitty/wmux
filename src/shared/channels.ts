 * drop causes (e.g. archived, rate-limited) extend it without breaking callers.
 *
 * Reasons:
 *  - `not_a_member` — the target workspace is not in the channel, so the whole
 *    mention was dropped. You cannot ping a workspace that isn't in the room.
 *  - `pane_not_in_workspace` — only the PANE PIN was refused: `paneId` is not a
 *    known pane of the mentioned workspace, so the daemon could not prove the
 *    caller is targeting a pane that workspace owns (a pin it cannot prove would
 *    be a cross-workspace paste primitive). The mention itself still landed, at
 *    workspace level (badge-only, the pre-pin behavior), and `paneId` carries the
 *    pane that was refused.
 *  - `pane_not_live` — the pane IS that workspace's, but no live session is
 *    behind it: the pane was closed, or its session died. Refused rather than
 *    routed, because a pin the receiving side cannot match does not fail — it
 *    degrades to workspace level, and the workspace-level paste lands in
 *    whichever agent that workspace still has. An instruction addressed to a
 *    departed worker would silently start a sibling worker's turn. The mention
 *    still lands at workspace level (badge-only) as above; what you are told is
 *    that the pane you named is not the one that would have acted on it.
 *
 *    "Live" here means A LIVE PTY, not a live agent. An agent can exit back to
 *    its shell while its pane and session stay perfectly alive; such a pin is
 *    accepted and the text lands at a shell prompt. Nothing in the delivery path
 *    models agent-exit today, so this reason does not promise more than it can
 *    check.
 *
 *    The check runs on the daemon at post time, and the receiving renderer
 *    re-checks at delivery time. A pane that dies between the two is still
 *    subject to the degraded workspace-level fallback described above — this
