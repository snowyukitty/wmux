// ─── Commander brain surface manifest (BYOB P4 role-gate SSOT) ──────────────
//
// The single source of truth for WHAT an orchestrator brain may touch, shared
// by every enforcement layer so the lists cannot drift:
//
//   Layer 1  src/mcp/index.ts        — in `--commander` mode the MCP child
//            registers ONLY COMMANDER_TOOL_SURFACE, so a brain's tools/list
//            simply does not contain teardown tools (fail-closed: an
//            unregistered tool cannot be called by ANY brain runtime, SDK,
//            ACP or otherwise).
//   Layer 2  src/main/pipe/RpcRouter — a request claiming the commander role
//            (a `commanderToken` field on the envelope) is validated BEFORE
//            trust/permission processing: invalid token → the whole request
//            is rejected (never demoted to an ordinary external caller);
//            valid token → TEARDOWN_DENY_METHODS are refused server-side.
//   Allow    src/main/mcp/PermissionEnforcer — a VALIDATED commander may call
//   lane     exactly COMMANDER_RPC_METHODS regardless of its MCP host's
//            clientInfo name. This is what lets a non-first-party brain host
//            (Hermes/OpenClaw) operate under production `enforce` mode: the
//            per-spawn token is the auth, not the self-declared client name.
//   SDK      src/main/deck/ClaudeSdkAdapter — DEFAULT_ALLOWED_TOOLS derives
//            from COMMANDER_TOOL_SURFACE, so the SDK auto-allow list and the
//            registered surface are the same list by construction.
//
// Threat model (plans/byob-role-gate-2026-07-17.md): a MISJUDGING brain, not
// a malicious same-user process — the #113 same-user pipe-token ceiling is
// unchanged. Design review basis: D2 (PR #401 era) allow-list, eng review +
// Codex outside voice 2026-07-17 (P0: enforce-mode lane, arg-vs-env split).

/** wmux MCP tool names (no `mcp__wmux__` prefix) a commander brain may hold.
 *  Mirrors D2: the whole read/observe family, pane spawn + drive (NEVER
 *  close/teardown), the channel/A2A comms bus, and the decision gate.
 *  browser_* and company_* are deliberately absent (out of commander scope).
 *
 *  Scope decision (GLM review, PR #475): READS are fleet-global, WRITES are
 *  confined to the commander's workspace. The brain legitimately reads other
 *  workspaces (fleet context, recovery, cross-workspace awareness) but every
 *  mutating path — terminal IO (deck.resolvePaneRoute token binding),
 *  pane.focus / pane.split / surface.new (ctx.commanderWorkspace pinning) —
 *  is server-confined to its own workspace. Same-user reads are already
 *  inside the #113 ceiling.
 *
 *  channel_mission_close is deliberately IN scope (not teardown): missions
 *  are the commander's own work objects — starting and closing them is the
 *  orchestration loop itself, unlike pane/surface teardown which destroys
 *  human terminal state. */
