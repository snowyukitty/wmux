 * script is the first non-flag token after the executable. #1027's third
 * defect was any-token comparison: `vim /path/daemon-bundle/index.js`
 * carries our script path in argv and "verified" as the daemon.
 *
 * Two signals, strongest first:
 *
 * **Identity.** `scriptCandidates` are the exact paths THIS host would spawn
 * (`deps.resolveDaemonScriptCandidates()`). A match at the entry position is
 * proof, not a pattern. On platforms whose probe returns a space-joined line
 * (macOS `ps`), a path with spaces arrives shattered across tokens — so the
 * comparison progressively re-joins tokens from the entry position, letting
 * a known candidate still match exactly. (On Linux the probe preserves the
 * NUL-split argv and no re-join is ever needed; on Windows the CIM command
 * line is quoted and the tokenizer keeps spaced paths whole.)
 *
 * **Exclusive cross-host fallback (#1001).** A daemon spawned by the OTHER
 * host kind (Electron vs the headless CLI) runs a script this host's
 * candidate list cannot name. Every packaged install's entry script is
 * `.../daemon-bundle/index.js` (package.json `build:daemon` esbuild
 * outfile), so accept EXACTLY that shape — at the entry position only, with
 * exact segment equality. #1027's second defect was `startsWith`: it
 * accepted `daemon-bundler/…` and `daemon-bundle-backup/…`, which are other
 * programs' names, not a renamed wmux directory. A cross-host DEV daemon
 * (tsc layout, no bundle) is deliberately not covered: refusing degrades to
 * the respawn budget, while a generic `daemon/index.js` marker is the exact
 * false positive #1025 reproduced by execution.
 *
 * Callers that cannot supply candidates get the fallback alone — refusing
 * to kill degrades safely, a false-positive kill does not.
 *
 * Known limitation (#1132): the fallback inspects the entry token alone, so
 * a CROSS-HOST daemon installed under a path containing a space still fails
 * to prove its identity on macOS — the script fragments and no candidate is
 * available to re-join it against. Widening the fallback to re-joined spans
 * would re-admit #1027's third defect (`node innocent.js <our path>`), and
 * an unproven identity refuses rather than kills, so the limitation is
 * accepted. The identity branch — the common case, same host — is fixed by
 * the comm anchor in `psArgvFromCommand`.
