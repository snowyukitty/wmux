// ─── Fresh context per dispatched task (#1680) ───────────────────────────────
//
// A long-lived worker pane carries one task's conversation into the next. A
// role can ask for a fresh conversation at the start of each dispatched task:
// wmux types the bound agent's fresh-context command (`/clear` for Claude Code,
// `/new` for Codex — agentLaunchOptions) before it delivers the task text.
//
// Two keys, both required:
//  - the CALLER declares the task boundary: `input.send` `newTask: true`
//    (MCP `terminal_send` `new_task`), or the new-task branch of an a2a send.
//    A reply or a status update never is one.
//  - the OPERATOR opted in: the pane's role binding has `freshContext: true`
//    and names an agent with a verified command (bindingEnforcesFreshContext).
// So an agent cannot clear a pane whose operator did not opt in, and an
// opted-in pane is never cleared on an ordinary message.
//
// Shared by main (the engine), the renderer (a2a delivery receipts) and the MCP
// server (client timeouts), which is compiled for ES2020 — keep this file free
// of newer APIs.

/**
 * What happened to a new-task send's fresh-context step.
 *  - `applied`: the command ran and finished; the text went to a fresh
 *    conversation.
 *  - `skipped_busy`: the agent was working, the composer held someone's draft,
 *    other input arrived while the command was typed, or (a2a) the pane still
 *    has other open tasks. The text was delivered WITHOUT clearing.
 *  - `skipped_mismatch`: the agent running in the pane is not the role's bound
 *    agent. Delivered without clearing.
 *  - `skipped_unobservable`: wmux could not see the pane well enough to type
 *    into it safely (no daemon state, unreadable screen). Delivered without
 *    clearing.
 *  - `not_bound`: the pane's role does not ask for fresh context (or its agent
 *    has no verified command). Delivered as usual.
 * A command that was typed but never seen to finish is not a result: the send
 * fails and the text is not delivered (see FRESH_CONTEXT_TIMEOUT_MS).
