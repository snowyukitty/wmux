// The walks below look like the ones above but diverge in signature or in what
// they return, so folding them in would be a behavior change, not a cleanup.
// They are listed so the next person does not have to rediscover them:
//
//   - workspaceMirrorSnapshot.findActivePtyId  — leaf lookup by activePaneId,
//     returns a ptyId not a pane.
//   - paneTraversal.findSurfaceByPtyId / findSurfaceById / findActiveLeaf /
//     collectTerminalSurfaces — surface-level results, terminal-only filters.
//   - workspaceSlice.removeWorkspace's collectSurfaces — returns {id, ptyId}
//     pairs, not panes.
//   - company/provisioner.collectPtyIds — leaf-only entry shape.
//   - uiSlice / projectConfigSlice / wmuxProjectConfig template walks — they
//     REBUILD trees (clone, assign ordinals, count) rather than flatten them.
//   - SessionManager.collectPtyIds (main process) — walks the on-disk session
//     shape, which is `unknown`-typed until validated.
//   - browserPane / focusedSurface / EmptyLeafFunnel / GitTab / ReviewTab and
//     friends — active-pane-relative lookups that intentionally see only the
//     visible tree.
