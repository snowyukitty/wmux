// Multi-target MCP registration registry.
//
// wmux registers its MCP server (`wmux`) into the config files of the AI-agent
// CLIs installed on the machine so each can discover the wmux MCP
// tools. Historically this was Claude-only (`~/.claude.json`). This table
// generalizes the set of supported targets; `McpRegistrar` (main process) and
// the `wmux mcp` CLI both iterate it through the shared `configIO` adapters so
// the two registration code paths stay in lock-step.
//
// EMPIRICAL GATE (see McpRegistrar.ts header): a target is only shipped as
// `verified` after its CLI was confirmed to (a) discover the wmux MCP server in
// the written config and (b) actually USE the tools (pass the daemon permission
// enforcer + resolve a workspace identity). Codex was verified 2026-06-15
// (clientName `codex-mcp-client`, added to FIRST_PARTY_CLIENT_NAMES). Gemini CLI
// is not installed here, so it stays unverified and is never created.
