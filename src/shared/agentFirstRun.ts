// ─── Fan-out worker first-run (A-1, orchestrator wave 2) ────────────────────
//
// A fan-out worker is a `claude` launched in a worktree the human has never
// opened. Wave 1 measured what that costs: 4/4 workers stopped on Claude Code's
// folder-trust prompt ("Is this a project you created or one you trust?") and
// then on a first-run onboarding prompt. `agentStatus` stayed `idle` and nobody
// pressed — these are not approval prompts, so no hook fires and no approval
// record exists. The brain saw silence and read it as work in progress.
//
// ── What was measured (spike, 2026-09-04, Claude Code 2.1.260) ──────────────
//
// Three candidates were tried against a real `claude` in a pty, in the order
// the wave-2 plan set:
//
//  1. A per-worker `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` seeded with onboarding/trust/auto-mode
//     state. REJECTED: the prompts do disappear, but the worker comes up "Not
//     logged in · Run /login" — credentials do not follow the config dir (macOS
//     keeps them outside it), and copying the account record does not change
//     that. A worker that cannot authenticate is worse than one that prompts.
//     It would also detach the worker from the user's own ~/.claude settings and
//     hooks, and the wmux hooks are what produce approval records at all.
//
//  2. An env Claude Code itself honours: `CLAUDE_CODE_SANDBOXED=1`. ACCEPTED.
//     Verified live: an untrusted throwaway directory, no trust dialog, and the
//     session authenticated normally. It short-circuits Claude Code's trust
//     resolution ahead of the `projects[path].hasTrustDialogAccepted` lookup, so
//     wmux writes NOTHING to the user's global config to get it.
//
//  3. Writing `projects[<worktree>]` into the user's `~/.claude.json`. NOT
//     NEEDED, therefore not done — candidate 2 is strictly less invasive.
//     (Recorded for the next reader: trust resolution walks PARENT directories.
//     Trust on `<root>/<repoHash>` covers `<root>/<repoHash>/<task-slug>`, which
//     is why wave 1's second run did not re-prompt even though no per-worktree
//     entry was ever written.)
//
// The trust dialog is not the only first-run screen, and that is the second
// half of this module. Claude Code shows a FAMILY of one-shot interstitials
// (the auto-mode environment onboarding wave 1 hit, a fullscreen-renderer
// upsell reproduced during the spike) gated on counters in the user's global
// config. `CLAUDE_CODE_SANDBOXED` does not suppress them, and writing those
// counters is global user state wmux must not touch. Each advertises `Esc to
// cancel`, and ESC was verified to dismiss one and land on the composer — so a
// worker stuck on a KNOWN first-run interstitial is answered with ESC, and one
// stuck on anything else is reported rather than guessed at.
//
// ── Why the detector is an allow-list ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// "A menu with a cursor row and an Enter/Esc footer" also describes an
// AskUserQuestion prompt and a permission gate — the two things that must NEVER
// be answered by a blind keystroke from main (that is what the approval
// registry, its hook provenance and `decideApprovalPress` exist for). So the
// detector requires a known first-run HEADLINE as well. A new Claude Code
// release that invents a new interstitial therefore falls through to "stuck",
// which reports and waits: the safe direction.
