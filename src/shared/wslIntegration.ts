  #
  # So ask an interactive shell what its PATH is, once, and only after the

  # sources, read here without its output reaching anyone. Startup chatter
  # cannot be mistaken for the answer — the marker line is the only thing read,
  # its leading newline starts it even after an unterminated banner, and the
  # LAST match wins so a .bashrc that echoes the marker itself cannot win over
  # the real one. stdin is closed so a prompt in a startup file cannot hang the
  # pane.
