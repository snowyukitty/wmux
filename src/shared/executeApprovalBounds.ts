/**
 * The time bounds on an A2A `execute: true` send, in one place (#1462).
 *
 * The send's reply is held while a person decides, and three layers each put a
 * deadline on that wait. They only work in this order:
 *
 *   approval window  <  renderer hard cap  <  main's wait  <  MCP client's wait
 *
 * Each layer must answer before the one above it gives up. If main gives up
 * first, a later approval creates the task in the renderer with nobody left to
 * spawn its worker; if the MCP client gives up first, the agent reads a timeout
 * while the prompt is still on screen, retries, and raises a second prompt.

 * (shared/freshContext.ts) — up to about 21 s with every read at its own
 * timeout. A prompt that stays pending close to the hard cap (40 s) plus that
 * worst case can outlast this wait. Main then answers with a timeout while the
 * renderer still creates and delivers the task; its worker is not spawned, and
