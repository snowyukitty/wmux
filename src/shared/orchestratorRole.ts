// orchestrator reads it (injected into its per-turn workspace snapshot, see
// deckBrain.buildWorkspaceContextSummary) and prefers to route matching work
// to the matching pane, but may deviate when the operator says so or when no
// pane fits. The key lives in the `custom` map (not the deprecated `role`
// metadata field) so it round-trips through pane_set_metadata's deep-merge.

/**
 * Pure transform: given a launch command + a role's binding, return the command
 * with the bound agent's model (and any extra args) enforced.
 *
 * The rewrite fires ONLY on something that is recognizably an agent launch.
 * Both gates below are load-bearing, because this runs on every submitted line
 * in a bound pane — including shell commands and prose sent to a live TUI:
 *  1. the launcher stem must be a known agent CLI (KNOWN_AGENT_STEMS). Chosen
 *     over MODEL_FLAG_BY_LAUNCHER so that `args`-only enforcement still reaches
 *     an agent whose `--model` grammar we haven't verified (opencode/gemini),
 *     while `git`/`ls`/`npm` are never touched by any part of the binding.
 *  2. the rest of the line must look like arguments, not prose — see
 *     {@link looksLikeLaunchInvocation}. A caller that SPAWNS the string rather
 *     than submitting it to a pane knows this without guessing, and says so with
 *     {@link ApplyRoleBindingOptions.spawnedProcess}.
 *
 * Rules once past the gates:
 *  - `binding.agent` set and the launcher stem differs → unchanged + a note
 *    (a policy deviation the operator should hear about).
 *  - `binding.model` without `binding.agent` → NOT injected + note. A model
 *    alias is only meaningful for a specific launcher's grammar; injecting it
 *    blind produced `codex --model haiku`, an invalid launch.
 *  - `binding.model` set but the launcher has no known `--model` grammar
 *    (gemini/opencode/aider) → not injected + advisory note (D-5). `args` still
 *    applies — it is launcher-agnostic.
 *  - An explicit `--model` already on the line → model NOT re-injected (D-4),
 *    though `binding.args` may still be appended.
 *  - Otherwise: inject `--model <m>` right after the launcher token and append
 *    normalized `binding.args` at the end.
 *  - `binding.effort` / `binding.skipPermissions` splice the agent's own flag
 *    (agentLaunchOptions) next to the model, unless that flag is already on the
 *    line or in the args. A permission flag in the args (`--permission-mode`)
 *    also stops the skip injection: the role's own config wins.
 *  - An explicit permission choice wins over the role's skip (#1681):
 *    {@link ApplyRoleBindingOptions.suppressSkipPermissions} (a toggle the user
 *    set OFF) or a permission flag typed on the line itself withholds the skip
 *    flag and drops the skip spellings from `binding.args`. A typed permission
 *    flag also drops the permission flags in `binding.args`, so the user's
 *    mode is the one that runs. The other args stay.
 *
 * `modelInjected` reports whether the model flag was ACTUALLY spliced in, so a
 * caller never advertises an enforced model when only `args` changed;
 * `optionsInjected` does the same for effort and skip permissions.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-applying never double-adds the model flag (an explicit
 * `--model` short-circuits) nor the args (token-boundary trailing check).
