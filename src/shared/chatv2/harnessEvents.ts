// The one event model of chat v2. A driver (daemon) emits HarnessEvents; the
// daemon stamps each with a seq and a time and folds it into the session with
// apply.ts; renderers fold the same stamped events with the same apply.ts.
//
// Changes from the source: request ids are strings (Claude's
// `control_request.request_id` is a UUID), generated images are path-only
// (no base64 in a snapshot), and two wmux events carry what the source kept
// outside its event stream: `user.message` (a turn the daemon accepted) and
// `turn.ended` (the turn's outcome).
