// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Browser action traces — the pure layer.
//
// A trace is a recorded sequence of successful browser actions that can be
// replayed later without the agent re-reading a snapshot. The saving is not
// the round trips: it is the SNAPSHOT the agent no longer has to read and
// reason about on every repetition of the same flow.
//
// mirrors stagehand packages/extension/services/cacheService.ts withCache —
// three of its operating principles, none of its code:
//   1. best-effort: a cache miss, a shape mismatch, or a malformed record must
//      never break the underlying action. The worst outcome is that the agent
//      does the work the slow way.
//   2. replay-fallback self-heal: a replay that stops mid-way reports WHERE and
//      WHY and hands the page back live, so the agent finishes by hand and the
//      next save records the healed path.
//   3. variable placeholders: a value the caller wants to vary between runs is
//      stored as `{{name}}` and substituted at replay time, so the trace never
//      holds the value itself.
// Stagehand caches on an XPath axis; wmux does not (see RefAxis).
//
// This module is deliberately transport-free and I/O-free: main owns the file
// (ActionCacheStore) and the MCP process owns the recorder and the runner, and
// both need the same vocabulary, caps, and hashing rules.

// The axis is what a step re-resolves against on replay. It is the snapshot's
// own RefEntry 4-tuple (role, name, sameNameIndex, sameNameTotal) and NOT an
// XPath or a DOM path: the 4-tuple is exactly what resolveRef already counts
// against, so a replayed step inherits the same staleness contract — including
// the "the population changed, refuse rather than guess" rule — instead of
// inventing a second, weaker one. A DOM restructure that leaves the button
// still reading as `button "Sign in"` re-resolves; an XPath would not.
//
// The 4-tuple alone cannot see a swap that keeps the count: insert one
// look-alike above the recorded element and remove one below, and N is
// unchanged, so the index still resolves and the click lands on a stranger
// (#1182). The axis therefore carries two more fields — `context`, the
// accessible name of the nearest named ancestor, and `own`, the element's own
// identifying attribute for the identical siblings a shared container cannot
// separate. Both are VERIFIERS, never locators: nothing is ever found by
// them, they can only contradict what the index found and stop the run. That
// keeps the refusal to key on position intact while removing the cases where
// position lies silently.
