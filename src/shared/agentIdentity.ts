// Single source of truth for agent identity: the slug, its display name, and
// the two lookups between them.
//
// Why this file exists
// --------------------
// The eight agent slugs used to be written out by hand in SEVEN places, and the
// slug<->display maps in two more, each carrying a comment telling the next
// person to keep the others in lock-step. That is exactly as reliable as it
// sounds: `src/renderer/channels/agentCandidateSeed.ts` shipped with SEVEN of
// the eight (`openclaude` missing) and nothing caught it, because
// `] satisfies AgentSlug[]` rejects EXTRA members but never OMISSIONS.
//
// The duplication used to have a stated reason -- "src/shared is the only
// directory the daemon's tsconfig includes, importing from main/ would invert
// the layering". Only the first half is true. `src/daemon/DaemonPTYBridge.ts`
// already imports `AgentDetector` straight out of `src/main/pty/`, so
// `rootDir: src` was never the constraint; only `integrations/` is genuinely
// out of reach. Putting the table here satisfies every consumer -- main,
// daemon, preload and renderer all import `src/shared` -- with no layering
// inversion and no second place to forget.
//
// This module imports NOTHING, deliberately: every layer depends on it, so a
// dependency here would be a cycle waiting to happen.
//
// Adding an agent
// ---------------
// Add one row below. That is the whole change: the union type, the runtime set,
// both lookups, the hook-envelope allowlist, the resume-binding allowlist and
// the channel-candidate allowlist all derive from this array.
//
// A row is NOT sufficient to make wmux *detect* the agent -- that needs a
// profile in `src/main/pty/AgentDetector.ts`, whose patterns must be captured
// from a live TUI rather than guessed (see the header there). Nor does it wire
// hook signals; those need `integrations/<agent>/`, which lives outside this
// build and stays hand-written.

/**
 * The canonical agent table. `slug` is the routing key: lowercase, no
 * whitespace, and never containing `:` -- `HookSignalRouter.key()` builds
 * `${slug}:${ptyId}:${kind}` and `dropPty` scans for the `:${ptyId}:`
 * substring, so a slug carrying a colon would make that scan ambiguous.
 *
 * `display` is what a human sees (sidebar label, pane badge). It travels on
 * the `agent.event` wire instead of the slug, because main reads that payload
 * straight into the sidebar and back through `agentDisplayToSlug`.
