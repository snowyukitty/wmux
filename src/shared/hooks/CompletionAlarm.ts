// CompletionAlarm — the verdict machine that decides when a pane's lead turn
// has ACTUALLY ended, gating the "work finished" alarm.
//
// Problem it fixes: raw stop-shaped signals (the vendor Stop hook, the
// detector's `waiting` heuristic, SubagentStop) fire while background
// shells/builds are still running or while the turn is merely repainting.
// Treating them as "done" tells the user work is finished when it isn't.
//
// Pipeline every cue passes through:
//
//   hook / detector signal
//     → normalize (working | attention | stop | session | answered)
//     → turn gate (did the agent work this turn? already announced?)
//     → provisional window (~1.5s, discarded when a rebuttal cue arrives)
//     → confirmed alarm | status only
//
// Rebuttal cues for a pending completion window: `working` (any tool
// activity, byte activity, prompt arrival) and `attention`. `answered`
// cancels a pending ATTENTION window. The HookSignalRouter dedup ledger is
// INDEPENDENT of this machine: with the wiring from the eng review, ledger
// writes for gated cue classes happen at CONFIRMATION, never at arrival, so
// a held-then-rebutted candidate leaves no ghost 'emit' behind and a
// confirmed broadcast can never carry a stale 'dedup'.
//
// State dots / fleet badges stay loose on purpose — only the alarm is
// strict. Callers keep their metadata broadcasts outside this gate.

 * - `attention`  — the agent is blocked waiting for a human (approval

 *                  which working cues do not rebut (see observe).
 * - `stop`       — a turn-end candidate. `child` marks subagent stops (never
 *                  a lead-turn end). `leftoverWork` is the count of
 *                  background tasks still running at stop time, mined from
 *                  the transcript tail by the bridge (>0 → the turn has NOT
 *                  actually ended; treat as working).
 * - `session`    — session boundary. Resets the turn gate.
 * - `answered`   — a pending question/approval was resolved. Cancels a
 *                  pending attention window.
