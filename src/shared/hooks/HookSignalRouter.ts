   * Deliberately NOT covered:
   *   - `awaiting_input` — Claude's hooks wire PreToolUse only for
   *     AskUserQuestion, so the ordinary approval prompts have no hook at all
   *     and the detector is their only source. Same carve-out the notification
   *     veto makes, and for the same reason.
   *   - `running` — a working cue, not a turn boundary; nothing about it
   *     competes with the Stop signal.
   *   - `complete` on a pane whose bridge has said `SessionStart` and nothing
   *     since. It is governed, but the hook has not written a lifecycle status
   *     yet, so withholding the detector's read leaves the roster on the gate's
   *     one-shot `running` — a launched-but-idle agent reading as busy, live-
   *     measured at 30+ seconds per launch. See `hookOwnsLifecycleAfter`. Once
   *     any other kind arrives the hook owns the lifecycle and this returns
   *     true again, so the post-Stop double-toast veto is unaffected. Only
   *     `complete` keeps this carve-out — see the `waiting` note below.
   *
   * `waiting` is withheld for the WHOLE authority window, SessionStart
   * included. Live finding (Claude Code 2.1.236, PR #1224 dev instance): a
   * fresh `claude` sitting at its prompt with no turn yet showed the red dot,
   * "Waiting", and "1 need you" in the titlebar. The SessionStart carve-out
   * above was letting the always-visible footer through as "Ready for input"
   * before the operator had typed anything. Since #1224 the hook owns both
   * ends of a governed pane's turn — `UserPromptSubmit` starts it, `Stop`
   * ends it — so the footer regex speaks for nothing there and can only cry
   * wolf. The pane is not left stuck busy either: no turn has been claimed,
   * so the byte-silence clear still settles it to idle. `complete` is
   * unaffected because it is a real turn-end read (Aider's "Applied edit
   * to"), never TUI chrome.
   *
    * An ungoverned pane (no bridge, or a TTL-bound bridge gone quiet past the
    * authority TTL) is unaffected: the detector stays the backstop it has
    * always been.
    *
    * Accepted cost, stated because a reviewer will ask: this rides the same
    * authority window as the notification veto. For a bridge that has ever
    * spoken a per-tool-call kind (the full profile, where the dormant gate
    * touches authority on every tool call) that window is the 30-minute
    * freshness TTL — a bridge killed while its agent process lives leaves the
    * status stale until the TTL expires, and `running` is never vetoed, so the
    * pane degrades to detector-truth rather than being silenced. For a
    * turn-boundary-only bridge (`--signals-only`, #979) the entry is
    * TTL-exempt (#1009): nothing such a bridge could send mid-turn would
    * refresh a TTL, so having one would strip this veto 30 minutes into a
    * long turn — the #935 report caught 21-22 minute turns on exactly that
    * profile — and hand the roster back to the always-visible footer the veto
    * exists to suppress. Such an entry is released only by confirmed process
    * death (`expireAuthorityFor`, wired to the daemon's liveness poll), by a
    * relaunch (`agent.session_start` resets lifecycle ownership), or by pane
    * dispose (`dropPty`). The residual failure mode is a signals-only bridge
    * killed with its process left alive: `waiting`/`complete` stay withheld
    * until death or relaunch, unbounded where the full profile bounds it at
    * 30 minutes. We take that trade with open eyes because the failure is
    * mild and one-directional — the pane degrades to stale-busy, never to a
    * false "needs you" — and a stale-busy pane is an annoyance where a false
    * roll-up count is the bug this veto exists to prevent.
