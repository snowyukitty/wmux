 * interleave in it. Two rules follow:
 *
 *   - The size is never cached, and is re-read before every append. An
 *     in-process byte counter drifts as soon as another process appends, and a
 *     drifted counter either rotates early (shredding the file into archives)
 *     or never rotates at all.
 *   - Rotation runs under an exclusive lock file and re-checks the size once it
 *     holds the lock. Without it, two processes crossing the threshold together
 *     both run the rename chain and the second one shifts a generation that the
 *     first already shifted, discarding a whole archive.
 *
 * That bounds the file without serialising the appends themselves. It does not
 * make the cap exact: `appendFileSync` opens with O_APPEND so no write is ever
 * torn or lost, but two processes can still read the same under-cap size and
 * both append, and an append can land in an inode another process is renaming.
 * The overshoot is one write per racing process, and it is deliberately
 * preferred over the alternatives — taking the lock per line would let one
 * process stall another's logging, and treating an over-cap file as junk to
 * truncate would discard log data to defend a number. Overshoot is carried into
 * the archive intact instead.
