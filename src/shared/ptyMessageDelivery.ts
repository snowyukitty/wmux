// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Per-agent submit profile (#1337)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Every structured message wmux pushes into an agent pane is written as two
// separate PTY writes: the bracketed paste, then Enter after a gap.
//
//   t=0                      t=SUBMIT DELAY
//   ├── ESC[200~ … ESC[201~  ├── '\r'
//   │   (paste lands in the  │   (agent's composer submits — or does not)
//   │    agent's composer)   │
//
// The gap is not cosmetic. A TUI that classifies a rapid run of input as a
// paste (Codex ships `tui/src/bottom_pane/paste_burst.rs` and a
// `disable_paste_burst` config key) can absorb an Enter that arrives while the
// burst is still open, leaving the nudge in the composer with no turn started.
// That is the most likely mechanism behind #1337; it is inferred from the
// render-timing measurements below, not observed directly in Codex's input
// buffer (see the bound stated after the table).
//
// MEASURED, not reasoned. codex-cli 0.154.0, driven through a real ConPTY on
// Windows, fed the exact bytes this function writes (bracketed paste, wait,
// CR), screen read back with a headless terminal and scored on the COMPOSER:
// a composer showing its placeholder took the draft, a composer still holding
// the nudge did not.
//
// Two machines, same binary and probe, pooled:
//
//     gap     paste PAINTED in the composer     nudge stranded
//             by the time the CR was written
//     100 ms  7 of 40 runs                      2 of 40 runs
//     500 ms  20 of 20 runs                     0 of 20 runs
//
// The RACE is the durable finding, not the rate. At 100 ms the Enter is
// usually written before the paste is even on screen; at 500 ms it never was.
// That ordering reproduced on both machines (5 of 20 and 2 of 20 painted at
// 100 ms, 10 of 10 each at 500 ms). The stranding is bursty and rare — both
// failures fell in one batch of ten, and the second machine saw 0 in 20 — so
// a short clean run does not disprove it and a short bad run does not size it.
// Roughly 5% here; do not quote it as a rate.
//
// WHAT THE ORDERING SIGNAL ACTUALLY IS, since the last table got over-read:
// it is read off the RENDERED SCREEN, so it says the paste had not been
// PAINTED yet, not that Codex's input buffer had not received it. The
// mechanism is an inference from render timing plus correlation (both stranded
// runs sat in the not-yet-painted group, and every 500 ms run was painted
// first), not a direct observation of the buffer. It is enough to size a
// conservative default. It is not proof of what the burst logic did.
//
// Do not trust any "stranded" count taken before this scorer existed: the
// earlier one keyed on the "Working" footer, which disappears as soon as the
// turn fails, so it miscounted submitted runs as stranded. It could not
// produce the opposite error, so its "submitted" observations still stand —
// which is why 300, 350, 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 2000 ms are all still known
// to submit.
//
// Two facts are keyed off the same signal, so they live in one table rather
// than two parallel ones that can drift:
//
//   submitDelayMs — how long to wait before Enter.
//   assurance     — whether wmux may claim the Enter actually started a turn.
//
// `assured` is reserved for Claude Code: wmux has a hook bridge that proves
// turn start there (agent.user_prompt_submit / agent.stop) and the whole of
// its dogfood history behind a bare CR. Every other agent, Codex included, is
// `unverified` — wmux writes the bytes and has no way to learn whether the
// composer took them. Same discipline as `keystrokesForAgent` in
// `src/daemon/approvals/approvalKeystrokes.ts`: an agent we have not measured
// gets the conservative answer, never a guess.
//
// UNKNOWN IS UNVERIFIED. A pane whose agent we cannot name may be a bare
// shell, a remote session, or an agent this build predates. None of those is
// evidence that Enter submitted anything.
