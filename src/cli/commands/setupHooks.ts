/**
 * `wmux setup-hooks` — install the wmux ↔ Claude Code hook bridge directly into
 * Claude Code's user settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`), WITHOUT requiring the
 * `/plugin marketplace add` flow. This is the plugin-LESS alternative to the
 * `wmux-claude-integration` Claude Code plugin: same 4 hook events, same proven
 * bridge script, but registered by editing settings.json instead of installing a
 * marketplace plugin.
 *
 * Why settings.json + a stable bridge path (NOT the install dir):
 *   Squirrel.Windows installs wmux into versioned `app-x.y.z` directories that
 *   change on every update. A hook command pointing into the install dir would
 *   break the moment the app updates. So we copy the bridge to a stable location
 *   under `~/.wmux/hooks/` and reference THAT path from settings.json — it
 *   survives app updates, and every `setup-hooks` run refreshes the copy so the
 *   bridge stays in sync with the installed app.
 *
 * Style mirrors `src/cli/commands/mcp.ts`: atomic tmp+rename writes,
 * prototype-pollution-safe JSON.parse reviver, findScript() upward-walk asset
 * discovery, and RegisterOutcome-style result objects.

wmux setup-hooks — install official CLI lifecycle integrations

USAGE
  wmux setup-hooks [--remove | --status] [--signals-only | --with-gate] [--json]

ACTIONS (mutually exclusive; default = install)
  (default)    Install or refresh Claude Code hooks, the Codex notify bridge,
               the Codex hooks bridge (config.toml [[hooks.*]] block; requires
               codex-cli >= 0.141.0 and STILL needs you to approve the hooks
               inside Codex — written ≠ installed), and the OpenCode lifecycle
               plugin. Existing foreign hooks, notify commands, and plugin
               files are never overwritten.
               Re-running KEEPS the hook profile already on disk.
  --remove     Remove only wmux-owned Claude hook entries (legacy behavior;
               Codex/OpenCode files and foreign configuration are untouched).
  --status     Report Claude, Codex, and OpenCode lifecycle integration status.
               For Codex hooks this includes the trust verdict: WRITTEN (block
               in place, Codex silently runs nothing until you approve it) vs
               ACTIVE (the bridge has actually fired).

HOOK PROFILE (install only; mutually exclusive)
  --signals-only  Install the lifecycle signals and the approval card WITHOUT
                  the wide PreToolUse permission gate. Nothing wmux owns then
                  runs per tool call, so the agent pays no hook cost between
                  turns — at the price of remote approvals, which stop working
                  until the gate is added back.
  --with-gate     Install the full profile, gate included (the default for a
                  fresh install). Use this to undo --signals-only.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json       Output raw JSON (useful for scripting).
`.trimStart();

/** Claude Code hook events wmux owns at matcher:'' (mirrors hooks.json). These
 *  fire at turn boundaries, never per tool call.
 *
 *  `UserPromptSubmit` is the turn START, and it is what makes a pane's
 *  `running` state hook-driven instead of a byte-rate guess. It is compatible
 *  with the 2026-07-13 decision that removed the matcher:'' PostToolUse hook:
 *  that removal was about a ~110 ms node bridge PER TOOL CALL, and
 *  UserPromptSubmit fires exactly ONCE per turn — the same cost class as Stop,
 *  which has always been installed.
 *
 *  `StopFailure` is the other half of that turn: Claude Code fires it INSTEAD
 *  of `Stop` when the turn ends on an API error, so a pane the turn-start hook
 *  lit had no turn-end signal at all on that path and kept its amber dot until
 *  the agent process died. Same once-per-turn cost class. */

 * Both are scoped to the AskUserQuestion matcher so they fire ONCE per

 * about a matcher:'' cost — a ~110ms node bridge per tool call feeding the
 * fleet "running" dot, which the daemon's byte-based ActivityMonitor now

 * update never refreshed it — the user had to re-run `wmux setup-hooks` by hand,
 * and a stale bridge silently keeps its old behavior (a real case: the log
 * rotation + activity-stamp throttle from the "30+ sessions" scaling fix never
 * reached an already-installed bridge, so its bridge.log grew without bound).
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow — this owns ONLY the plugin-LESS copy under
 * `~/.wmux/hooks/`, and only when settings.json actually references it. It does
 * NOT touch the marketplace plugin's own bridge under
 * `~/.claude/plugins/cache/…` — that copy is versioned and updated by Claude
 * Code's plugin system, not by wmux. And like the statusline refresh it never
 * writes settings.json, so it cannot enroll a user or resurrect a hook they
 * removed: no wmux hook groups → 'not-installed', nothing happens.
 *
 * The settings reference is checked BEFORE the file is read, so a hook still
 * pointing at a bridge that has since been deleted is REPAIRED rather than
 * written off as uninstalled — otherwise every configured hook would keep
 * targeting a nonexistent file and this reconcile would never fix it.
 *
 * tmp+rename because the bridge is spawned on every Stop/SubagentStop/etc.; a
