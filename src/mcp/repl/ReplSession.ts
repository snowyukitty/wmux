/**
 * One persistent Node runtime, owned by one MCP connection.
 *
 * Why a child process and not `node:vm` in this process: REPL code is code the
 * caller wrote seconds ago and has never run. It calls `process.exit()`, it
 * blows the heap, it throws out of a native callback. In the broker topology
 * this process hosts EVERY agent's MCP connection, so an in-process runtime
 * would turn one agent's typo into every agent's outage. A child process makes
 * the blast radius exactly one session.
 *
 * Lifecycle, and every way a session ends:
 *
 *      spawn ──► starting ──ready──► idle ◄────────────┐
