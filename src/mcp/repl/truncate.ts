/**
 * Bounded output capture for the agent REPL.
 *
 * A REPL runs code the caller wrote seconds ago, so `while (true) console.log(x)`
 * is a routine mistake rather than an exotic one. The MCP server that holds these
 * buffers is the shared broker hosting EVERY agent's connection, so an unbounded
 * accumulator is a cross-agent memory fault, not a local one.
 *
 * OutputBuffer therefore retains a bounded head and a bounded tail and forgets
 * the middle, while still counting every byte that ever arrived:
 *
 *     ┌──────── head (75% of cap) ────────┬─ elided ─┬─ tail (25%) ─┐
 *     │ the first output, where the run    │ counted  │ the last     │
 *     │ announces what it is doing         │ only     │ output, where│
 *     │                                    │          │ it failed    │
 *     └────────────────────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────────┘
 *
 * Both ends matter: the head says what the script started doing, the tail
 * carries the error it died on. Keeping only the head would hide every failure
 * that happens after a chatty loop.
