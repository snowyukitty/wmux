/**
 * Thin stdio shim — the per-agent MCP process under the broker topology
 * (plans/mcp-broker-design-2026-07-16.md Option A).
 *
 * The agent CLI spawns this instead of the full MCP bundle. It does exactly
 * two things:
 *   1. asserts who it is to the broker (one JSON handshake line carrying
 *      its pid/ppid, the pane env hints, and the pipe auth token), and
 *   2. pumps bytes: stdin → broker pipe, broker pipe → stdout.
 *
 * It deliberately imports NO MCP SDK, no zod, no tools — its whole value is
 * weighing ~bare-node instead of ~32 MB. Identity stays sound because this
 * process sits in the agent's own process tree exactly where the old child
 * sat: the broker starts its PID walk from the pid asserted here, and the
 * ancestry chain it walks is this shim's.
 *
 * Failure contract: if the broker connection drops mid-session, the shim
 * EXITS (non-zero). MCP servers are stateful per session (initialize
 * handshake), so a silent reconnect would leave the host talking to a
 * server that has forgotten the handshake. Exiting surfaces the standard
 * "server died" path that hosts already know how to restart. At STARTUP,
 * connect retries briefly with backoff so a broker that is still booting
 * (app launch race) doesn't fail the first agent spawn.
