/**
 * Password-value redaction for browser tool output.
 *
 * An agent driving a logged-in page needs to SEE the login form — the field,
 * its label, its name, whether it is filled — but the password itself has no
 * business reaching the model's context or the transcript. This module is the
 * single place that decides what counts as a password field and what replaces
 * its value.
 *
 * What Chrome already does, measured on Chrome 141 against a three-field form
 * (`Accessibility.getFullAXTree` after setting each `.value`):
 *
 *   input[type=password]                  AX value = "•••••••••••••"  (masked)
 *   input[type=text autocomplete=…]       AX value = "newpassSECRET"  (PLAIN)
 *   input.value read from page JS         always plaintext
 *
 * So the a11y tree covers exactly one shape, and only that one. A `type=text`
 * field carrying `autocomplete="new-password"` — what a "show password" toggle
 * and most signup forms produce — hands back the plaintext, and every DOM-side
 * path (`el.value`) hands it back regardless of type. The same measurement also
 * showed Chrome repeats the value a second time as `StaticText` descendants of
 * the input (its shadow editor's text), so redacting the a11y node's `value`
 * alone is not enough — the subtree has to go with it.
 *
 * The rule everywhere here: redact the VALUE, never the field. Role, label,
 * name, ref and the fact that the field is non-empty all survive, because
 * that is what the agent needs to fill the form at all.

 * module comment measures. The `i` flags matter: `type` is matched
 * ASCII-case-insensitively by the HTML spec on its own, but an attribute
