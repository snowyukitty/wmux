// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Keeping an emulated User-Agent applied.
//
// `Emulation.setUserAgentOverride` is scoped to the CDP session that sent it:
// Chromium disables the emulation handler when the session detaches, and the
// override goes with it. Opening a session, sending the override and detaching
// in a `finally` therefore reverts the very thing it just applied.
//
// It is also per target. `context.setExtraHTTPHeaders` covers every page in the
// context, so a UA header applied context-wide alongside a page-scoped hints
// override would disagree again the moment a second tab opened — the same class
// of mismatch the override exists to remove.
//
// So this module holds one live session per page for as long as the emulation
// is meant to last, and re-applies the override to pages that appear later.
//
// The same session carries the rest of the preset. A device preset used to
// reach the page as a UA string and a viewport width and nothing else, so an
// emulated iPhone answered `navigator.platform === 'MacIntel'`,
// `maxTouchPoints === 0` and `devicePixelRatio === 1` — every one of them
// contradicting the UA it had just announced. `platform` rides along on the UA
// override; the metrics and the touch points need their own commands, sent
// here so they live and die with the same session.
//
// `navigator.platform` needs one more thing than the others, and the reason is
// measured rather than guessed. Of everything the override carries, platform is
// the only value Chromium keeps as a page-wide setting instead of as state
// belonging to the session that wrote it. Every DevTools session that detaches
// from a target resets that setting on the way out — including a session that
// never wrote a platform of its own. So a throwaway session opened on the page
// for something unrelated (asking a target for its id, setting a timezone) put
// the host's platform back the moment it detached, while the UA string, the
// hints, the pixel ratio and the touch points all stayed. Measured on a live
// page: after the preset, `Linux armv8l`; after one unrelated session attached
// and detached, `MacIntel`, with everything else still emulated. That is why
// the earlier reading of this — another session outwriting ours — was wrong:
// nothing else writes a platform, and re-sending the override from the session
// still held here restores it immediately.
//
// Re-sending is therefore not a one-time step but a standing obligation, and
// `reassertUserAgentEmulation` below is where the page is put back before a
// tool looks at it.
//
// Input reaches the page too, and by the same route. `page.tap()` is refused
// client-side — the context this process attached to was built without touch —
// and two ways round that were measured and rejected:
// `Emulation.setEmitTouchEventsForMouse` does convert clicks into real touch
// events, but the mouse dispatch that produced them then never returns (>30s,
// every click), and a device-built context is not this architecture — it would
// be a fresh incognito-like context with none of the user's cookies, history or
// extensions, which is a louder signal than the one it removes.
//
// So the touch events are sent directly, as `Input.dispatchTouchEvent`, on the
// session held here (`activeTouchSession` below, dispatched from
// `touch-input.ts`). Reusing this session rather than opening one is not an
// economy: a session opened for the tap and detached afterwards would reset
// `navigator.platform` on the way out, for the reason set out above.
