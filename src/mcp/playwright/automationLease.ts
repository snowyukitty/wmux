// The two drains cannot double-report: both rings are drained destructively,
// and the two sources are mutually exclusive (main cannot see chrome tabs).

// commit the navigate RPC resolves on) is delayed, not lost — the next op's
// pre-drain picks it up. When the body throws, the post-drain is skipped and
// its events likewise survive in the ring for the next op; the PRE-drained
// events are lost with the error (destructive drain — no re-queue), which
