// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Continuation cursors for a truncated snapshot.
//
// A snapshot that overflows its length budget used to leave the agent two ways
// forward, and BOTH re-capture the page: a bigger maxLength, or a narrower
// selector/q. The page moves under a re-capture, and a re-capture opens a new
// ref generation — so reading the second half of a big page cost the refs of
// the first half. A cursor instead serves the next WINDOW of the same stored
// capture: no page read, no new ref generation, and every ref in every window
// is one the single capture minted.
//
// Windows are cut at line boundaries. A snapshot line is one node with its
// ref, so half a line is not something an agent can act on — the budget
// therefore bounds the window, and a line that is alone longer than the budget
// is still emitted whole (otherwise a cursor could never make progress).
//
// The budget has TWO halves and a line must fit both. Characters, because that
// is what the snapshot's own maxLength counts; and UTF-8 bytes, because every
// tool result then passes the dispatch-layer cap (src/mcp/resultCap.ts), which
// elides the MIDDLE of an over-cap text block. A window that overran the byte
// cap would come back with a hole in it while its trailer still promised
// continuity from the line it ended on — lines no cursor could ever reach, and
// an "(end of capture)" that claimed otherwise. So the window is sized to the
// byte cap up front and the elision never fires.
//
// Mechanism credit: continuation-cursor pagination over one stored page
// capture is Tencent/BrowserSkill's (MIT); referenced as prior art. No code
// copied.
