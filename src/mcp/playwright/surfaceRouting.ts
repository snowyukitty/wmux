/**
 * Which browser surface a call that omitted `surfaceId` belongs to.
 *
 * The default used to be "the newest surface in the caller's workspace", which
 * is the right answer only while one agent is driving. Two agent panes in one
 * workspace hold two MCP connections, and both resolved to the same newest
 * surface: the second agent's browser_navigate drove the first agent's tab,
 * and every following call kept overwriting the other's page.
 *
 * So the default is per CONNECTION, not per workspace:
 *
 *   1. the surface this connection last OPENED (its pin), while it still exists
 *   2. otherwise the newest surface this connection opened
 *   3. otherwise the newest surface NOBODY claims — restored after a restart,
 *      opened by a person, or opened before this shipped — which this
 *      connection then ADOPTS, so the next connection does not take it too
 *   4. otherwise nothing: the caller opens (and pins) its own rather than
 *      taking over a surface another connection opened
 *
 * The opener key is a random id minted once per connection and sent with every
 * open, so main can record who asked for a surface. Main answers only with a
 * verdict — mine, another's, or unclaimed — never with anyone's key, so no
 * caller can learn another connection's identity from wmux.
 *
 * It is an identity HINT, not a credential, and cannot be anything stronger
 * here: `sendRpc` opens a fresh socket per call (wmux-client), so main has no
 * transport-level connection to bind the identity to. Nothing rests on it that
 * would not already be true without it — ownership decides only where an
 * UNSAID target lands, and an explicit surfaceId still reaches any surface in
 * the workspace, including another connection's.
