//
// Everything else about this feature is pinned against stubs: jsdom for the
// in-page rules (no layout, so every geometry veto is faked) and a recording
// fake for the CDP lane (no renderer, so no `:hover` ever actually fires). Both
// were green while the live behaviour was wrong in three separate ways — a nav
// whose every item got marked, a marker on a line with no ref, and a probe that
// reported nothing on a page whose menus opened fine (dogfood, 2026-09-18). A
// hover is a layout-and-cascade effect; the only honest test of one runs in a
// browser.
//
// Skipped, not failed, where Chrome is absent: this is the runtime suite, and it
// must stay runnable on a machine without a browser installed.
