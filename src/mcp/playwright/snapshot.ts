/**
 * The two text roles Chrome stacks under every piece of visible text, and the

 *
 * Chrome renders `<h1>Dogfood page</h1>` as THREE lines — the heading, a
 * `StaticText` repeating its name, and an `InlineTextBox` repeating it again —
 * so a button costs three lines to say one word. Measured on a real dogfood
 * page that made "Dogfood page" appear three times on one screen, and across
 * live pages the two text roles are the single largest slice of the output
 * (Wikipedia: 963 InlineTextBox + 776 StaticText lines out of 3327).
 *
 * An `InlineTextBox` is the layout engine's per-line fragment of its parent
 * `StaticText`, never new text. Measured on Chrome 141 over 3054 InlineTextBox
 * nodes on three live pages (Wikipedia, Hacker News, a modal fixture): every
 * one of them had a `StaticText` parent whose name contains its text — zero
 * exceptions — apart from three under a `LineBreak`, whose text is "\n". So
 * dropping them loses wrapping positions and nothing else.
 *
 * That is a measurement, though, not a guarantee, so the drop is CONDITIONED on
 * the parent role it was measured under (TEXT_FRAGMENT_PARENTS). A different
 * Chrome major, an SVG text run, or a Blink change that hangs an InlineTextBox
 * under a nameless container would then have it as the only carrier of that
 * text — and this module would drop it silently, which is the exact failure the
 * condensation exists to avoid. Outside the measured shape the node is kept:
 * the output gets bigger, never emptier.
 *
 * A `StaticText` is dropped only in the one case where it is provably an echo:
 * it is its parent's ONLY child and serialises to exactly the parent's own
 * name with no attributes and no children of its own (see serializeNode).
 * A `link "A B"` over `StaticText "A"` + `StaticText "B"` keeps both — the
 * pieces are not the accumulated name, and which piece sits where is signal.
 *
 * 'aria' keeps everything: its contract IS the full tree, and it is the format
 * to reach for when the layout-level text really is what you are after.

// degrades to the DOM listing (#1356).

// it. Everything after that is the code the slow path runs, unchanged — the

 * Snapshot only the subtree of the first element matching `selector`, via the

 * layout: the DOM listing hands out refs for `visibility:hidden` /
 * zero-box elements, and every click on one of those refs timed out (dogfood
 * P0). It also meant `format:"aria"` was silently unavailable whenever a
 * selector was given. The a11y tree already encodes what is actually rendered,
 * so scope through it instead and keep the DOM listing as the fallback.
 *
 * Scoping resolves DOM → a11y through `backendNodeId`, the id space both CDP
 * domains share: `DOM.querySelector` for the element, then only that element's
 * subtree, fetched with `Accessibility.getPartialAXTree` +
 * `Accessibility.getChildAXNodes` (see fetchScopedTree). The full tree stays the
 * fallback for everything the subtree fetch will not answer for, and is indexed
 * by backendDOMNodeId exactly as it was — the output is the same either way.
 *
 * Returns null (never a partial or wrong-scope result) when the a11y route
 * cannot serve the request — no CDP session, collapsed tree, selector miss, or
 * an element with no a11y presence — so the caller falls back to the DOM
 * listing, which stays the last resort and the source of the "no match" error.
