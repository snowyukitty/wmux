/**
 * "Is there a menu behind this nav item?" for browser_snapshot.
 *
 * A snapshot lists `link "Products"` and nothing under it, because the
 * submenu the site puts there only exists while the pointer is on the link:
 * a `:hover` rule flips a panel from `display:none`, or a framework mounts it
 * on `mouseenter`. The tree is telling the truth about the page as it stands,
 * and the agent reads it as "this site has no Products menu" — then goes
 * looking for a search box, or reports the feature missing. Mega-menus, avatar
 * / account menus and "more" (…) buttons are all this same shape, and
 * snapshot.ts had no notion of them at all.
 *
 * Two phases, because the cheap one is the one worth always paying for:
 *
 *   Phase 1 reads the page's OWN stylesheets and ARIA and marks the triggers
 *   it can prove are triggers (`has-submenu`). It never touches the page — no
 *   pointer, no DOM write — so it is on for every snapshot.
 *
 *   Phase 2 (`probeHover:true`) actually hovers the top few and lists what
 *   appeared. That moves the real pointer, so it is opt-in, hard-bounded, and
 *   restores the pointer afterwards.
 *
 * Precision is the constraint, same as occlusion.ts: a missing marker leaves
 * the agent exactly where it is today, a WRONG marker sends it hovering a
 * plain link and waiting for a menu that was never there. So every bound here
 * fails open — a stylesheet that throws, a scan that runs out of time, a
 * selector that will not parse, all produce "nothing to say" rather than a
 * guess — and the scorer needs corroboration (a CSS rule, an ARIA promise, a
 * native disclosure) before anything is marked.
 *
 * Mechanism credit: hover-revealed submenu detection was observed in
 * Tencent/BrowserSkill (MIT), referenced as prior art. No code copied.

/**
 * One step of the probe, run in the page with the TRIGGER as `this`.
 *
 * Two modes rather than two functions so the "is it showing?" predicate has a
 * single definition: `before` records what is hidden, `after` asks which of
 * those exact elements is now showing, and the two must agree character for
 * character or the probe reports a reveal that never happened.
 *
 *   before(targetsJson, anchor)             -> { url, vw, vh, b*, hidden }
 *   after(hiddenArray, anchor, aimJson)     -> { url, ok, names, revealed, named, vw, vh, b* }
 *
 * `before`'s `hidden` comes back as live element handles; `after` is handed that
 * same array, so it asks about the same elements without re-querying — a
 * re-query after the hover would also pick up whatever the hover ADDED and could
 * not tell the two apart. `aimJson` carries `{x, y, cap}`: where the pointer was
 * put, and how many names to return.
 *
 * The box is the ANCHOR's, not the trigger's: the anchor is what the agent is
 * told to hover, and it is the element the hover is aimed at. Scoping still
 * comes from the trigger, because that is what the `:hover` rule hangs off.
