 * back to the absolute path only when the root is not under the home directory
 * at all, where accuracy has to win.
 *
 * Accuracy also wins for a WSL caller: its `~` is the Linux home, not the

/**
 * The one gate on what a page may be handed, and the reason it is unchanged by

 *
 * The route changed from "Node reads the bytes and streams them" to "Chrome
 * opens the path itself", which sounds like it widens the blast radius and does
 * not: Chrome runs as the same user and could always read anything this process
 * could. What matters is that the string handed to the browser is the one this
 * function RETURNED — the realpath'd, root-checked value — and never the
 * caller's raw input. Both call sites below use `safePaths` only.
 *
 * Four ways out of the root, and what stops each:
 *  - `..` segments — path.resolve() normalises them before any check.
 *  - a symlink/junction inside the root pointing out of it — realpathSync()
 *    resolves it, so the relative check runs against the true target.
 *  - another drive or a UNC share (`E:\x`, `\\host\share\x`) — path.relative()
 *    then returns an absolute path, which path.isAbsolute() rejects.
 *  - a path that does not exist, where realpath cannot run: it stays lexical,
 *    but a path Chrome cannot open is a path Chrome cannot leak. fs.existsSync
 *    resolves links exactly as the browser would, so "exists" and "openable"
 *    are the same question here.
 *
 * Note what is NOT on that list: a path that EXISTS and whose realpath still
 * cannot be computed. Every guarantee above rests on resolving links first, so
 * on that input the gate would quietly become a lexical string compare — a
 * weaker check of a different kind — and that lexical string is exactly what
 * Chrome would then be asked to open. It is refused instead. existsSync does
 * not throw, so the only inputs that get there are already anomalous.
 *
 * The residue is TOCTOU — swapping the file for a symlink between this check
 * and the upload — which needs write access to the uploads root and is no wider
 * than it was when Playwright did the reading.

 * 50MB ("Cannot transfer files larger than 50Mb to a browser not co-located
 * with the Playwright client"). Measured: 49MB uploads, 50MB is refused. Every
 * video worth uploading is bigger than that, so the whole tool was unusable for
 * the one job it exists for.
 *
 * The premise behind that refusal does not hold here. wmux only ever attaches
 * to a browser on THIS machine — `http://localhost:<port>` for a dedicated or
 * Electron instance, `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>` for a live-Chrome attach (see
 * PlaywrightEngine.connect and LiveChromeClient) — so the browser can simply
 * open the file itself. `DOM.setFileInputFiles` passes the path and nothing
 * else, which makes the transfer free and the size limit disappear.
 *
 * If wmux ever attaches to a browser on another host, this route becomes wrong
 * (the path would resolve over there) and must be gated on the endpoint being
 * loopback. Nothing in the engine can produce such an endpoint today.
 *
 * Returns false when the CDP route is unavailable or the selector matches
 * nothing, so the caller can fall back rather than fail the upload outright.
 * A `DOM.setFileInputFiles` rejection is NOT swallowed: the element was found
 * and the browser refused it, which the caller must report, not retry.
