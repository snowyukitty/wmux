/**
 * Machine-readable effect trailer for the mutating browser tools.
 *
 * Every mutating tool already says what happened in prose, and prose is the
 * one thing an agent cannot act on after a timeout: "locator.click: Timeout
 * 30000ms exceeded" does not say whether the click went out. So the agent
 * retries — a second submit on a form that already posted — or gives up on a
 * flow that actually worked. That ambiguity is not hypothetical: it is why
 * `browser_file_upload` already carries a hand-written duplicate-upload warning
 * on a measured timeout (see describeUploadTimeout in tools/file.ts), and why
 * `browser_download` puts the tab back when its click navigated instead. Both
 * of those are one tool telling one caller in prose; this is the same answer
 * for all of them, in a form a caller can branch on.
 *
 * So the results of the tools that put INPUT on a page end with two lines the
 * agent can branch on:
 *
 *   effect_state: none | committed | unknown
 *   error_code: <code>            (error results only)
 *
 * That is browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill, browser_press_key,
 * browser_hover, browser_drag, browser_select, browser_scroll,
 * browser_scroll_into_view, browser_navigate, browser_navigate_back,
 * browser_file_upload, browser_download and browser_dialog. Tools that change
 * something OTHER than the page's own state — browser_evaluate, browser_tabs,
 * browser_open/close, browser_emulate, browser_resize, browser_highlight, the
 * cookie and storage writes — are not covered yet; extending the contract to
 * them is a follow-up, not a reason to word it as if they were.
 *
 * `none` means nothing was dispatched and a retry is free. `committed` means
 * the input reached the page. `unknown` means a dispatch went out and its
 * outcome cannot be read from here, which is the only case where the agent has
 * to look at the page before doing anything else.
 *
 * The prose is left exactly as it was: the trailer is appended, never a
 * replacement, so a caller that reads the first line keeps reading the same
 * first line.
 *
 * Read-only tools (snapshot, screenshot, extract, console, network, cookie and
 * storage reads, wait) carry NO trailer — they have no effect to report, and a
 * trailer on them would train the agent to read one where it means nothing.
 *
 * Mechanism credit: reporting a tool's side-effect state as a machine-readable
 * trailer so the caller can tell a retryable failure from an ambiguous one;
 * Tencent/BrowserSkill (MIT) and jackwener/opencli (Apache-2.0) referenced as
 * prior art. No code copied.
