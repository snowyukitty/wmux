// Element descriptors — what a ref number MEANS, kept across snapshots.
//
// A ref number alone is only as good as the snapshot that minted it. Two lanes
// mint refs positionally (the DOM interactive listing that browser_snapshot
// falls back to, and getSmartSnapshotViaEval), so opening a dropdown renumbered
// a link from 2 to 14 and the ref the agent was holding was rejected as stale
// even though the element had not moved (#1355).
//
// A descriptor — role + accessible name + nth-of-kind — is what survives that.
// It is used for exactly two things, and they are the same match:
//
//  1. STABLE NUMBERING. A re-snapshot of the same surface gives an element
//     whose descriptor matches a previous ref that same number again; genuinely
//     new elements take numbers after the previous maximum, so a number is
//     never reused for a different element.
//  2. RECOVERY. A ref from an earlier generation that the current listing does
//     not carry is looked up through its stored descriptor. Exactly one match
//     in the current listing → act on it and say so. Zero or several → the
//     caller keeps its stale error, because a guess is the one outcome worse
//     than a refusal.
