/**
 * Path translation for an MCP server launched for an agent inside WSL.
 *
 * The server itself runs on Windows (Electron runtime via WSL interop), so
 * every path it computes — home, ~/.wmux, temp — is a Windows path, while the
 * agent calling the tools lives in Linux and reads and writes Linux paths.
 * The launcher (WSL_MCP_LAUNCH) says so through two env vars:
 *  - WMUX_WSL_DISTRO: the distro name; non-empty means a WSL caller.
 *  - WMUX_WSL_MOUNT: what `wslpath -u 'C:\'` answered, e.g. `/mnt/c/`. Empty
 *    when wslpath was unavailable, in which case the default `/mnt/` root is
 *    assumed.
 *
 * Without WMUX_WSL_DISTRO every function here is the identity, so non-WSL
 * callers see byte-identical tool output.
 *
 * Env is read on every call rather than cached at import: it is fixed for the
 * life of a production process, and tests need to flip it.
