// ─── Fan-out tool for the bundled MCP server ────────────────────────────
//
// `fanout_start` exposes the `task.fanout.start` pipe RPC: one prompt → N
// isolated git worktrees, each with its own workspace, agent pane and mission
// channel. Until now fan-out was reachable only from the GUI modal, so an agent
// supervising a fleet could not open one.
//
// The tool schema deliberately has NO agent-command, workspace, member or
// repository input. The CLI is chosen by NAME only — `agents[].agent` is a slug
// from a closed table and `preset` names operator data — never by command. Those are all derived server-side from the caller's
// verified identity (see src/main/pipe/handlers/fanout.rpc.ts); exposing them
// here would only invite callers to send values the handler rejects — or, for
// the agent command, would be arbitrary command execution.
//
// The call is accept-then-poll. A fan-out takes far longer than the client's
// RPC deadline, so the first call returns `accepted` and the work continues in
// the background. Re-sending the same idempotency_key reports the state:
// `awaiting_approval` while the user is being asked, then `running`, then
// `completed` with the full per-task result — or `denied`, with the reason, if
// nobody approved it.
