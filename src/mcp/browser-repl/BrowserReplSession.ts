/**
 * One `browser_repl` runtime per MCP connection: a worker thread that holds
 * the script's globals between calls, plus the run queue in front of it.
 *
 * Runs are serialized. Two concurrent `browser_repl` calls on one connection
 * would otherwise interleave their `browser.*` calls on the same page — each
 * script's snapshot invalidated by the other's clicks — with nothing in either
 * result to show it happened.
 *
 * A timeout terminates the worker. That is the only way to stop a synchronous
 * loop, and it costs the script's state; the outcome says so and the next run
 * starts a fresh worker. Handler calls still in flight when the worker dies
 * run to completion (a half-finished click is worse than a finished one) and
 * their results are dropped — but the next run waits for them to land first,
 * or the dead run's late click would slip between the new run's snapshot and
 * its own click, which is exactly the interleaving the queue exists to stop.
