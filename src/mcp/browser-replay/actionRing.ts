// The recording ring.
//
// Why a ring and a later cut, rather than an explicit record start / stop:
//
//   1. Success is known AFTERWARDS. An agent does not know a flow was the
//      right flow until it worked, and by then a "start recording" call would
//      have had to be made before the first attempt — i.e. before there was
//      any reason to make it. So every successful action is recorded
//      unconditionally, and `browser_replay {action:'save'}` cuts the tail.
//   2. An open recording session has no owner. If the agent stops, crashes, or
//      simply moves on, something has to close the session and decide what to
//      do with the half-recorded flow. A ring has nothing to close.
//
// The ring is per-CONNECTION and there is NO process-wide fallback. The broker
// hands every accepted connection its own McpServer, so a shared ring would let
// one agent's actions be cut into another agent's trace — and both would look
// perfectly ordinary in the result. A connection without a ring records
// nothing, which costs a save and can never mix two agents together.
//
// Within one connection the entries are still tagged with the browser scope
// they happened in, because a single agent can drive several workspaces and
// surfaces through one server.

   *      `save` usable with no argument at all.
