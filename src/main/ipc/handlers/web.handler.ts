 *
 * Two differences from lanlink.handler.ts, both deliberate:
 *
 *  1. It takes a live `getDaemonClient` getter and registers UNCONDITIONALLY
 *     (not gated on a DaemonClient snapshot). The web toggle is always present
 *     in the titlebar, so a click must ALWAYS resolve — never throw "No handler
 *     registered". When the control operation cannot complete, the handler
 *     resolves `{ running: false, error }` so the popover can render the actual
 *     failure instead of surfacing an exception toast.
 *
 *  2. Every method resolves a WebTerminalInfo (never rejects) for the same
 *     reason — a browser-terminal toggle is a low-stakes convenience surface,
 *     not a data-integrity path.
 *
 * The daemon.web.* RPCs return the WebInfo shape directly as the RPC result
 * (see cli/commands/web.ts, which reads `response.result as WebInfo`);
 * DaemonClient.rpc resolves that `result` for us.
