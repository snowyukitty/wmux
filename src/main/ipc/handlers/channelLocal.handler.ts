// Renderer-only channel-mutation IPC (D5) — thin first-party surface that lets
// the in-app channels UI (create + composer post) mutate channel state even
// though it has no PTY.
//
// Why this exists, and why it is sound:
//  - The pipe-facing `a2a.channel.*` handler (a2a.channel.rpc.ts) resolves an
//    unforgeable `verifiedWorkspaceId` from a verified `senderPtyId` and FAILS
//    CLOSED on a mutating call with no resolvable senderPtyId. The in-app
//    composer/create UI is not a PTY, so it has no senderPtyId — through the
//    pipe handler every renderer create/post would be NOT_AUTHORIZED.
//  - This channel is registered with `ipcMain.handle` (NOT on the pipe
//    RpcRouter), so it is reachable ONLY from the renderer process — a
//    same-user named-pipe / MCP client physically cannot invoke an Electron
//    IPC handler. This is the identical renderer-only boundary that
//    projectConfig.handler.ts relies on for its trust mutation.
//  - The renderer is the first-party GUI and the source of truth for the
//    company/CEO identity, so the renderer-supplied `verifiedWorkspaceId` (the
//    active human/CEO workspace) is trusted HERE and forwarded to the daemon.
//    The daemon's authz gates (sender-pin, membership, archive member/CEO) are
//    identical to the MCP path — but the TRUST BASIS of `verifiedWorkspaceId`
//    differs and is weaker: the MCP path resolves it from an unforgeable
//    `senderPtyId` (input.findOwnerWorkspace), whereas this path has no PTY and
//    trusts the renderer's claim, sound ONLY because this IPC is unreachable
//    from the pipe. There is no second anchor here — the security rests
//    entirely on the process boundary, bottoming out at the same same-user
//    ceiling.
//  - This does NOT widen the same-user ceiling: an attacker who wants to
//    post-as-CEO must reach the daemon control pipe directly (the documented
//    residual — plans/trust-root-security-epic-plan.md F1), which this path
//    neither enables nor depends on.
//
// Reads stay on the existing `a2a.channel.*` pipe handler (they accept a no-PTY
// caller and fall back to the caller scope); only the channel-mutating methods
// are routed here.
