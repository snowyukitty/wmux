// Main-process HTTP/SSE bridge to a remote wmux daemon's web server.
//
// Talks to the same routes the browser frontend uses (WebTerminalServer.ts:
// `handleStream`/`handleInput`), but from the main process instead of a
// browser tab — so it can set an `Authorization` header directly rather than
// relying on EventSource's query-string token, and it drives the pane state
// for Task 5's IPC handler instead of a DOM terminal.
//
// Observe + input + exactly ONE destructive verb (#1129): `closeSession`
// (`DELETE /api/sessions/:id`), the teardown twin of `createWorkspace`. This
// class mints sessions on the remote host, so it is also what must end them —
// closing a remote-terminal tab would otherwise leave the shell (and the
// workspace row the daemon derives from it) running forever. Nothing else
// here deletes anything on the remote; `detach`/`detachAll` are LOCAL stream
// teardown and leave the remote session untouched, on purpose.
//
// `resizeSession` (#1322) is neither observe, input, nor destructive — it
// changes two numbers on a struct via the same `POST /api/sessions/:id/resize`
// route the phone already uses (#766). Reused, not reinvented: the route's
// ownership rule already grants a resize to whoever asks when no desk viewer
// on the remote host is looking at the pane, which is normally true of every
// session this client mints (see the method's own doc comment).
