// ─── task.fanout.start — fan-out on the pipe / MCP surface ─────────────────
//
// J1 fan-out (one prompt → N isolated worktree tasks) was renderer-only: the
// GUI modal invoked `fanout:start` over ipcMain and the pipe RpcRouter had no
// registration, so an MCP client could not run one. This handler is that
// registration — but it is NOT "the IPC handler with a router line". The IPC
// path trusts every field because a human typed it into the modal; the wire
// does not. So this handler builds a FanOutRequest from a STRICT SUBSET of
// caller input plus server-derived values, and shares the IPC path's
// FanOutService instance (idempotency is an instance property).
//
// The gates, in order:
//
//   R4 origin allowlist — `ctx.origin === 'local'` or reject. Verbatim from the
//      a2a execute precedent (a2a.rpc.ts): fan-out spawns N processes and
//      mutates a git repository, so remote/undefined/unknown fail closed.
//   R2 identity — verifiedWorkspaceId is RESOLVED from senderPtyId via the
//      renderer (the D5 anchor a2a.channel.* mutations use), never read from
//      params — sending one is REJECTED, on the same reasoning as repoPath
//      below. An unresolvable caller gets nothing. `memberId` is likewise not
//      a wire field: it is the caller's coordinate in the mission-channel
//      roster, and accepting it without the reserved-identity guards would let
//      a caller stamp its missions under someone else's name.
//   R3 repo confinement — the fan-out repo is the git toplevel of the cwd of
//      the CALLER'S OWN SURFACE (the pane whose ptyId === senderPtyId),
//      realpath'd, and re-derived once more after the approval so the repo the
//      user saw is the repo that gets mutated. `repoPath` is NOT a wire field:
//      a caller-supplied one is REJECTED, not ignored, because silently
//      ignoring it would let a caller believe it fanned out over repo B when it
//      actually fanned out over repo A.
//   R1 agentCmd — never read from the wire. FanOutService.buildInitialCommand
//      interpolates it UNQUOTED into `<agentCmd> "$(cat '<path>')"` and writes
//      that to a PTY, so a wire value is plain shell injection. Forced to
//      FANOUT_WIRE_AGENT_CMD. (The prompt body itself never reaches the shell
//      parser: it goes to prompt.md, read back through a single-quoted path.)
//   R5/R6 caps — N ≤ FANOUT_MAX_TASKS, effective prompt ≤
//      FANOUT_PROMPT_MAX_BYTES, title ≤ CHANNEL_TOPIC_MAX, checked here (not
//      only inside the service) so the wire gets a wire-shaped rejection and an
//      oversized array is bounded before any per-element work.
//   R7 approval — see below.
//   R8 runaway brakes — depth-1 (a fan-out task cannot fan out), the app-wide
//      live / hourly caps, and the audit record written before anything
//      spawns (worktask/fanoutGuards.ts). With approval off by default these
//      are what stop a loop.
//
// Asynchrony is forced, not chosen: the MCP client's RPC deadline is 10s
// (wmux-client.ts) and one task's renderer spawn alone is allowed 30s. So the
// call is accept-then-poll — re-send the same idempotencyKey to get
// awaiting_approval / running / completed / denied. The poll answer comes from
// FanOutService's existing G1 bookkeeping plus the gate map below.
//
// R7 — by default fan-out does NOT ask (owner decision 2026-09-24): the
// renderer answers `fanout.requestApproval` with outcome 'auto', shows one
// toast, and R8's brakes carry the load. The Settings switch (main-side,
// fanoutWorkerPolicy.ts — main decides and passes `requireApproval`) turns the
// ask back on, and then it is NOT the a2a execute gate:
//
//   * It reuses the execute approval queue and dialog (one inbox, one timer),
//     but it goes through requestFanOutApproval, which does NOT consult
//     `a2aAutoApproveExecute`. That toggle is consent for A2A background
//     execution; it is not consent for creating N git worktrees and branches,
//     and letting it cover fan-out would silently widen a setting the user
//     agreed to for a different action.
//   * Because the call is async, the prompt no longer blocks the caller — so
//     the 30s auto-deny costs nothing except the fan-out. But it must not cost
//     it SILENTLY: an unattended fleet learns via the poll, which reports
//     `status: 'denied'` with the reason (declined / timeout / unavailable /
//     repo-moved) rather than letting the key go quiet.
//   * The prompt shows the EFFECTIVE prompt of every task — shared + per-task,
//     exactly what each agent is handed — and says so in bytes when it has to
//     cut. A preview built from the shared prompt alone can be filled with 500
//     benign characters while the real instructions ride in `taskPrompts`, and
//     an approval given to a preview that does not contain the instructions is
//     not consent (see buildFanOutPreview).
//
// Residual: `senderPtyId` arrives in params, not from the connection peer PID,
// so a same-user process can forge it — the #113 ceiling documented at length
// in a2a.channel.rpc.ts. Attribution here is advisory in exactly the same way;
// this handler is no weaker and no stronger than the channel surface it mirrors.
