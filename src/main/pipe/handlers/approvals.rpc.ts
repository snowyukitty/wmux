// ─── approval.press — the brain's way to answer a worker's prompt ───────────
//
// Before this, a brain that saw a worker waiting on an approval had exactly one
// move: `terminal_send` the literal text `1`. That is not an approval — it is a
// keystroke aimed at whatever happens to be on that screen. Nothing checked that
// a prompt was still there, nothing recorded a decision, nothing consulted the
// press scope (#1199/#1201's `decideApprovalPress` governed only
// `daemon.approvals.resolve` callers, which a brain was not), and the same three
// bytes typed a second later land in the composer of an agent that has already
// moved on.
//
// So the press goes through the machinery that already exists for the phone:
// the daemon's ApprovalRegistry. It does the CAS, re-reads the pane to confirm
// the prompt is still on screen, sends the keystroke the RECORD specifies (never
// caller-supplied text), and writes the decision into history.
//
// WHAT THIS HANDLER ADDS, and it is deliberately little:
//   - target resolution: a brain knows a pane (`ptyId`), not an approval id;
//   - the AUTOMATED declaration. Main is a first-party pipe client, so the
//     daemon would otherwise classify this press as 'human' and skip the press
//     scope entirely — the scope would then govern nothing, because no other
//     caller class reaches that RPC. See approvals/resolveRequest.ts.
//
// AUTHORIZATION IS TWO CHECKS, and neither is pane ownership in the ordinary
// sense — a brain pressing its worker is BY DEFINITION reaching into another
// workspace, so the usual `assertWorkspaceOwnsPty` would refuse the only call
// this exists for. Instead:
//
//   1. DELEGATION, checked here. The caller must hold a validated commander
//      token (`ctx.commanderWorkspace`), and the pane's workspace must be a
//      task workspace the TASK LEDGER says that caller owns. Without this, one
//      brain could press another brain's workers: the daemon's scope only asks
//      "is this pane SOMEBODY's delegated task workspace", never whose.
//   2. POLICY, checked by the daemon's `decideApprovalPress`: autonomy on, the
//      effective `approvalPress` capability on, a hook-sourced record, and the
//      prompt still on screen.
//
// A refusal comes back with its reason so the caller can act on it rather than
// guess (see the policy-refusal note below).
