// ─── task.gate.* / task.adopt / task.close / task.pr on the pipe ─────────────
//
// Closing a task, opening its PR, adopting its result and running its gate were
// all reachable from exactly one place: the Electron renderer, over ipcMain. An
// orchestrator brain is not a renderer, so it could start N tasks and then do
// nothing with any of them — it could only ask a human to click. These five
// methods are that missing half, and they are deliberately the SAME services the
// GUI drives (TaskCloseService, TaskPrService, TaskGateRunner, TaskAdoptService)
// rather than a second implementation with its own rules.
//
// The gates, in the order they run, and all of them verbatim from the fan-out
// handler next door (fanout.rpc.ts) because these calls are strictly more
// destructive than spawning a worktree:
//
//   R4 origin allowlist — `ctx.origin === 'local'` or reject. A remote caller
//      never closes a task or writes to a repository.
//   R2 identity — the caller's workspace is SERVER-RESOLVED: a commander token
//      (ctx.commanderWorkspace) outranks a stated senderPtyId, and a pane agent
//      is resolved from its verified pty. A caller-supplied
//      `verifiedWorkspaceId` is REJECTED, not ignored — being silently
//      overruled leaves a caller believing it acted as someone it is not.
//   Ownership — the task must appear in `task.mission.list` scoped to that
//      resolved workspace. That list is owner-scoped by the daemon, so "not in
//      it" covers both "no such task" and "someone else's task"; the two are
//      reported apart only where doing so leaks nothing (an unknown id is not
//      evidence of another workspace's task, because the answer is the same).
//   Materialization — close/pr/adopt/gate all need a worktree on disk. A task
//      that never materialized is refused with that reason rather than a
//      confusing git error.
//
// Approval (integration lane, superseding the "none is raised here" this file
// shipped with): `task.close` and `task.pr` DO raise a human prompt, through
// the same renderer gate fan-out uses. The reasoning that said one prompt was
// enough assumed every caller is an MCP tool behind a PreToolUse permission
// gate — but the caller these methods exist for is an orchestrator brain whose
// commander surface auto-allows its own tools (ClaudeSdkAdapter's
// DEFAULT_ALLOWED_TOOLS), so for that caller there was no first prompt to be
// the second of. Removing a worktree and pushing a branch to someone's GitHub
// are the two effects here a human cannot undo by reading a result.
//
// Gate/adopt/read stay unprompted: a gate run is reversible by ignoring it,
// adopt lands in the LOCAL repository and never pushes (`git reset --hard`
// undoes the staged default, `git reset --hard HEAD~1` the `commit: true`
// form), and the git/gh views only read.
//
// `task.close` is deliberately NOT in COMMANDER_TEARDOWN_DENY. That set is an
// unconditional refusal in RpcRouter, evaluated before any handler runs, so
// listing it would mean a brain can open tasks and never close them — the
// exact half-loop this file exists to finish. The prompt is the control
// instead; see the note on COMMANDER_TEARDOWN_DENY in commanderSurface.ts.
