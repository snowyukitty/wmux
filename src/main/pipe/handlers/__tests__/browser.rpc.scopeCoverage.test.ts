// #810 — structural invariant: no target-resolving browser handler may pick a
// workspace on its own.
//
// The hole this guards is how #810 happened in the first place. Scoping was
// added handler by handler, so "is this call scoped?" was answered by whoever
// wrote the handler, and a later one that forgot simply kept the old
// workspace-blind lookup. Nothing failed; the gap was invisible until someone
// re-read the file.
//
// A behavioral test cannot catch that: it can only assert about handlers it
// already knows to check, which is exactly the set that is not the problem.
// So this reads the source instead and asserts the shape:
//
//   registerBrowserRpc
//     │
//     ├─ registerLeased('browser.X', (params, scope) => …)
//     │     └─ scopeFor() runs in the wrapper, once, before any lookup
//     │
//     └─ router.register('browser.Y', (params, ctx) => …)
//           └─ must call scopeFor() itself if it resolves a target
//
// Precedent for source-scan invariants in this repo: remoteInboxNoPaste.test.ts.
