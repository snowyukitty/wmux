// ─── Fresh context per dispatched task: the engine (#1680) ───────────────────
//
// Types the bound agent's fresh-context command (`/clear`, `/new`) into a pane
// before a NEW task's text is delivered, and waits until the pane shows the
// command finished. The policy (two keys, result values, timeouts) is in
// src/shared/freshContext.ts; this file is the sequence and its guards.
//
// Runs in main for both delivery paths: `input.send` with `newTask`
// (terminal_send `new_task`) and the a2a new-task branch's gated submit. Every
// read and write goes through an injected probe, so the whole sequence is
// testable on a fake clock with a scripted pane.
//
// Order, and why:
//   1. The role must ask for it and name an agent with a verified command
//      (else `not_bound`). A caller that knows the conversation must be kept
//      (a2a: other open tasks on the pane, or open tasks that cannot be read)
//      gets `skipped_busy` with nothing typed.
//   2. The daemon must know the pane (else `skipped_unobservable`): its
//      canonical agent name, status, key-input counter and incarnation are the
//      safety proof. A local (pre-adoption) pty has none.
//   3. The agent running there must be the bound one (else
//      `skipped_mismatch`). agentVerified is reported, not required (owner
//      decision: Windows process attribution can fail).
//   4. The agent must be idle per the daemon AND the renderer, and nobody may
//      have typed in the last few seconds (else `skipped_busy`). Busy panes
//      get the text without a clear (owner decision).
//   5. The command is typed (no Enter). The cursor row must then hold exactly
//      a prompt glyph and the command: anything else is a draft someone left in
//      the composer, so the command is erased again and the text delivered
//      without a clear (`skipped_busy`). The daemon's key-input counter must
//      have moved by exactly our one write. If someone typed alongside us,
//      the send fails with nothing more written: erasing would delete their
//      characters, not ours.
//   6. Enter. Then wait for the evidence (below). No evidence within
//      FRESH_CONTEXT_TIMEOUT_MS: FreshContextTimeout, and the caller writes
//      NOTHING else — the pane may still be clearing, and text typed now could
//      land in the old conversation.
//
// "Typed" means KEY input: the daemon's key-only counter, which focus reports
// and pointer-motion reports do not move. Agents turn on any-motion mouse
// tracking and focus reporting, so the all-writes counter moved whenever the
// operator's pointer crossed the pane. An older daemon without the key counter
// falls back to the all-writes one: conservative (a pointer can make the step
// skip or fail), never permissive.
//
// Evidence that the command finished, checked every poll after Enter:
//   - always: same incarnation, no key input since our Enter, the bound agent
//     is not showing a prompt (`awaiting_input`), the command has left the
//     cursor row, and two screen reads at least FRESH_CONTEXT_SETTLE_MS apart
//     are identical. A running status is NOT disqualifying: the redraw after
//     `/clear` byte-promotes the pane for a moment.
//   - plus a SessionStart hook from the bound agent with a fresh source,
//     received after our Enter → signal `session_start`.
//   - or the screen → signal `screen`. The screen above the cursor row must
//     differ from what it was before the command (the old conversation is
//     gone), and Codex must show its banner (it redraws it for a new chat,
//     #1610). A screen that looks exactly as before (an already-empty
//     conversation) counts only after holding still for
//     FRESH_CONTEXT_UNCHANGED_HOLD_MS (reason `screen_unchanged`), and never
//     when the daemon confirms the agent's hooks work, nor on a Codex pane
//     that showed a conversation before the command.
//   - Claude's hooks report `/clear` as SessionStart(clear), so a pane whose
//     CURRENT agent has reported hooks (main holds a receipt from it, and the
//     daemon, when it can tell, says that agent's hooks reported) waits for
//     the hook first — but only FRESH_CONTEXT_HOOK_GRACE_MS past the screen
//     evidence, then takes the screen (reason `session_start_missing`). A
//     receipt left by an earlier run of the agent, or hooks that stopped
//     reaching wmux, cost a few seconds, never the task.
