   * unstamped workspace. Trusting a stated pty is safe here for the same reason
   * the stamp is: inheriting can only take fan-out away.
   *
   * Fail-closed, in two halves. BEFORE the create: a stated senderPtyId that
   * does not resolve, or a lineage store that cannot be read, refuses the
   * call. AFTER it: if the caller is a task and the stamp cannot be written,
   * the new workspace is closed again and the call fails — an unstamped
