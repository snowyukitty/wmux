/**
 * Compute the caller-derived browser scope.
 *
 * #846 landed this table in shadow; it is now what target lookup actually uses
 * under `mcp.mode: enforce` (see `scopeFor` below).
 *
 * The table itself is unchanged by the enforcement step. Enforcing it did
 * surface one broken caller — `wmux browser navigate` outside a wmux pane omits
 * `workspaceId` on purpose while still sending its `clientName`, so it would
 * have been refused in every packaged build — but the fix belongs on the CLI,
 * which now asks `workspace.current` instead of leaving the server to guess.
 * A lane keyed on the CLI's `clientName` was tried and rejected: `clientName`
 * is self-asserted, so any wire caller could claim it and buy back exactly the
 * unscoped access this closes.
 *
 * Read that near-miss as the shadow evidence being weaker than it looked: #846's
 * window recorded no `browser.*` traffic at all, so it validated nothing about
 * these callers.
 *
 * What this closes and what it does NOT (#810, be precise — the tool layer has
 * been mistaken for a boundary before):
 *
 *   closes  an approved THIRD-party caller that OMITS `workspaceId` no longer
 *           falls through to the workspace-blind "first registered surface"
 *           lookup; it is refused. This is the caller #810 describes.
 *   closes  a pinned commander can no longer name a workspace other than the
 *           one its validated token is bound to.
 *   closes  (#922) an approved IFRAME PLUGIN can no longer point a browser
 *           target lookup — every `browser.*` method that resolves through
 *           `scopeFor` — at a workspace other than the one hosting it. It used
 *           to reach `declared` and receive whatever workspace it named, while
 *           #719 already held it to the active workspace for OBSERVATION:
 *           "may watch here, may act anywhere" was an asymmetry, not a
 *           decision. Confined to THIS table: the renderer's own fallbacks
 *           (`pane.list`, `browser.open` in `useRpcBridge.ts`) resolve a
 *           workspace without ever reaching here. #922 PR2 covers those at
 *           dispatch instead (`hostedWorkspaceBinding.ts`) — including
 *           `browser.open` / `browser.close`. #922 PR-C then routed those two
 *           through this table as well, once the `verified` lane gave an
 *           omitted `workspaceId` an answer — see the closes entry below.
 *
 *           Both mechanisms still apply to those two, and that is deliberate:
 *           the dispatch binding runs regardless of `mcp.mode`, so a hosted
 *           plugin stays confined even in shadow, where this table is inert.
 *           Removing the dispatch coverage now that the lane exists would hand
 *           shadow-mode plugins back the reach #1097 took away. They do not
 *           fight: dispatch fills `workspaceId` with the host binding, and the
 *           hosted lane then sees a request that names its own workspace.
 *   closes  (#922 PR-B) a wire CALL that presents a claim token is scoped to
 *           the workspace that claim created. `mcp.claimWorkspace` mints the
 *           token bound to it (`workspaceClaimTrust.ts`), so the association is
 *           one main RECORDED rather than one the caller asserts — the
 *           `verified` lane below. A presented claim that has gone stale is
 *           refused rather than demoted into `declared`.
 *
 *           Read that scope literally: it binds the CALL, not the caller. The
 *           lane keys on the token being PRESENT, and nothing server-side
 *           records that a given caller ever claimed — `clientName` is
 *           self-asserted, which is why keying on it was rejected. So a caller
 *           that omits the field is indistinguishable from one that never
 *           claimed and lands in `declared`, with the freedom that lane still
 *           has. The bundled client stamps the token on every envelope once it
 *           holds one, so an honest caller is bound; a determined one drops a
 *           field. Closing that gap needs a server-side record of who claimed,
 *           which is the same missing primitive the OPEN items below name.
 *   closes  (#922 PR-C) `browser.open`, `browser.close` and `browser.tabs`
 *           resolve through this
 *           table instead of handing the request's `workspaceId` straight to
 *           the renderer or the surface lookup. `open` / `close` fell back to
 *           the UI-active workspace; `tabs` acted on whatever it was given.
 *           They were held out while `declared` accepted any named workspace,
 *           because
 *           folding them in would have newly refused an approved wire caller
 *           that omits the field. The `verified` lane answers that caller now,
 *           so the remaining refusal is the one every sibling `browser.*`
 *           method already gives: this stops two methods being the exception,
 *           rather than tightening the rule. The 'external' backend is
 *           excluded — it hands the url to the OS browser, which belongs to no
 *           workspace.
 *   narrows (#922, owner ruling (c)) the `legacy` lane no longer resolves an
 *           OMITTED workspaceId through the workspace-blind "first registered
 *           surface" lookup; that case is refused. The lane is NOT closed — a
 *           legacy caller that names a workspace is unchanged, byte for byte —
 *           because closing it belongs to the shared grandfather deprecation
 *           with `PermissionEnforcer` (#1111), not to this table. Narrowing the
 *           scope without touching the allow keeps one clock, not two.
 *   OPEN    the `declared` lane still checks that `workspaceId` is PRESENT, not
 *           that it is the caller's own, for a wire caller that never claimed.
 *           Nothing binds a bare clientName to a workspace, and the name is
 *           self-asserted, so binding to it would be no stronger than the
 *           capability check that already keys on it.
 *   CLOSED  the `legacy` lane, at the gate rather than here: #1111 closed
 *           `PermissionEnforcer`'s grandfather, so under enforce mode an
 *           envelope-less wire caller is refused before it reaches this table.
 *           The lane below remains for shadow mode (the dev default), where
 *           the handler still runs after the rejection is logged.
 *
 * The hosted lane closes one caller CLASS, not the general problem: it works
 * only because the plugin host derives both halves of the identity itself. The
 * verified lane closes a second class — wire callers that claimed — the same
 * way: on a binding main recorded, not one the caller named.
 *
 * Peer credentials (`GetNamedPipeClientProcessId`) were the shape #922 first
 * suggested and are NOT what landed. The OS handle behind a Node pipe socket
 * is unreachable from JS (measured: the accepted socket reports
 * `_handle.fd === -1`), so it needs a compiled native addon — and it would buy
 * nothing against the ceiling below, since same-user code defeats both.
 * `workspaceClaimTrust.ts` records the reasoning.
 *
 * Ceiling, stated so the lane is not read as more than it is: this confines an
 * APPROVED plugin to the scope its approval implied. It is not a defence
 * against hostile code already running as the user.
