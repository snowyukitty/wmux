// ─── a2a.channel.* RPC handler ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Pipe RPC surface → daemon ChannelService (which owns canonical channel
// state, U3). MCP/pipe clients use these handlers for ALL channel ops; the
// renderer uses them for READS only (list/get/getMessages/getMembers).
// Renderer MUTATIONS do NOT come through here — the in-app UI has no
// senderPtyId, so a mutating call fails closed (D5, below), and instead rides
// the dedicated renderer-only `channels:mutate-local` IPC
// (src/main/ipc/handlers/channelLocal.handler.ts, pipe-unreachable). These
// handlers exist so a caller talks to one RPC router and the enforcer can gate
// them against `a2a.channel.read` / `a2a.channel.send` capabilities
// (methodCapabilityMap.ts).
//
// D5 — caller-identity server-pin. The daemon trusts `verifiedWorkspaceId`
// for every authz gate (post: sender===verified; reads: membership/
// visibility). That field MUST NOT be a client-supplied
// value, or a forger sets sender.workspaceId AND verifiedWorkspaceId to a
// victim's (public) ws-id and sails through. So here, BEFORE forwarding to
// the daemon, we OVERWRITE verifiedWorkspaceId with a value resolved from a
// verified `senderPtyId` — the same anchor a2a.task.send uses (the MCP
// server supplies its own PID-map-walked ptyId). We resolve ptyId → owning
// workspace via the renderer (`input.findOwnerWorkspace`), exactly as
// `a2a.resolve.identity` does (a2a.rpc.ts).
//
// Mutating methods (create/join/leave/post/invite) REQUIRE a resolvable
// senderPtyId and fail closed without one — so a renderer composer / headless
// caller with no PTY cannot mutate (it is read-only). (archive + kick are
// humans-only and not registered here at all — see the NOTE in the registrar.) Read methods accept a
// no-PTY caller and fall back to the caller-supplied scope: the renderer is
// trusted by the process boundary, and this is the documented same-user
// residual (a same-user process can already read every workspace's token —
// see plans/trust-root-security-epic-plan.md F1) — EXCEPT the reserved human
// workspace: a ws-human read scope is first-party only (ctx.firstParty),
// since W1's operator observation makes it a skeleton key to every private
// channel's full history (see the gate in forward()). NOTE (audit B1 — naming
// honesty): `senderPtyId` arrives in the request PARAMS and is NOT bound to the
// pipe connection's PID, so a same-user pipe client can forge it (a victim's
// live ptyId is enumerable via a2a.discover). Treat the resulting
// `verifiedWorkspaceId` as ADVISORY attribution under the #113 same-user ceiling
// — NOT an unforgeable cross-user boundary. The only real improvement over the
// old path is that it no longer rides the spoofable WMUX_WORKSPACE_ID env hint;
// a true fix derives identity from the connection peer PID
// (GetNamedPipeClientProcessId) — see plans/channels-fix-plan-2026-06-29.md
// strategy track (B1/B2/B3).
//
// Handlers MUST NOT emit events themselves; `channel.message` emission is
// owned by ChannelService inside its per-channel critical section (plan KTD3),
// bridged to the EventBus in DaemonClient.ts / DaemonNotificationRouter.ts.
