// orchestrator read it as "the agent got my prompt" and reported progress on
// panes that were still sitting on an uncommitted line. Raw PTY byte activity
// is not a receipt either — a TUI echoes every keystroke and repaints its
// cursor, so bytes flow whether or not anything was committed.
//
// Two signals are accepted, both of which require the pane to have MOVED:
//   (a) turn start — a prompt-submit hook received AFTER our \r, with a
//       running status. A freshly built mirror snapshot alone is not evidence.
//   (b) composer cleared — the text we just typed has LEFT the composer area
//       at the bottom of the screen. Positional (see `rowFromBottom`), because
//       a TUI like Claude Code re-renders the submitted prompt into its
//       transcript: the string is still on screen, just no longer down there.
//
// Both are narrower than they look, and deliberately:
//   - `running → awaiting_input` is NOT a turn start. It is what a PREVIOUS
//     turn ending inside our window looks like.
//   - agentStatus is byte-promoted (#935), so the pane's own echo of our text
//     can flip it to running before anything was submitted. A snapshot built
//     after the \r can still carry that echo promotion; require the hook too.
//   - "the needle moved up one row" is NOT acceptance. That is precisely the
//     soft-newline failure this whole change exists to catch (the composer
//     grew a line and pushed our text up), and background output does it too.

   *   - No ptyId: forward params as-is so the renderer resolves the active pane

   *     caller's OWN active pane, not the globally UI-focused one (resolving via
   *     a workspaceId-less resolveActivePtyId would read whatever the user has
   *     focused and wrongly reject a legit same-workspace caller). Re-assert the

   * #922 PR2 — note what this assert does and does not answer. `callerWs` comes

   * pty agree; it never checks that the named workspace is the caller's. For an
   * iframe plugin those were different questions: naming a foreign workspace
   * passed, because the pty really does live there. The missing half is now
   * supplied at dispatch — `hostedWorkspaceBinding.ts` pins `workspaceId` to
   * the workspace hosting the plugin before this handler runs, so `callerWs`
   * is the binding and the early-return is unreachable for that caller class.
   *
   * Fan-out T5 — an explicit ptyId may also name a pane of an OPEN task the
   * caller owns (assertCallerMayAccessPty). That lane never reads `callerWs`:
   * identity is the commander token or main's resolution of `callerPtyId`, and
