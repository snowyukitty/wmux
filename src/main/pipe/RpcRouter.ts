/**
 * Human-readable error message for an RpcRejection. Composed inline at
 * dispatch time so external clients reading only `error` (without the
 * structured `rejection`) still see something useful. The structured
 * variant has the full per-path detail.
 *
 * `observedClientName` is the name the caller actually reported (RpcContext).
 * Identity rejections echo it back (issue #636): the agent behind an MCP client
 * does not otherwise see what its client library put in `clientInfo.name`, and
 * without it the only way to learn the name is to read
 * `~/.wmux/plugin-trust.json` by hand — which is what led a real agent to guess
 * its own name wrong. It is echoed as-is and clipped; it is untrusted,
 * self-asserted input (§2.3).
