// #922 PR2 — dispatch-level hosted workspace binding.
//
// PR1 (#941) gave the iframe plugin host a server-derived workspace on
// `RpcContext.hostedWorkspace` and taught `browser.rpc.ts`'s `callerScope` to
// scope on it. Only that one handler file consults the binding; the rest of
// the method space still resolves a workspace out of the REQUEST BODY, and for
// a family of methods that resolution happens in the renderer:
//
//   `typeof params.workspaceId === 'string' ? params.workspaceId : store.activeWorkspaceId`
//
// Nine sites in `useRpcBridge.ts` have that shape. Each then resolves inside
// the named workspace with no ownership check, so an approved plugin that
// names a foreign workspace is answered about it — enumerating that
// workspace's panes (`pane.list`), reading its scrollback and viewport
// (`pane.search`, `input.readScreen`), creating a pane in it (`pane.split`),
// or opening and closing browser surfaces in it (`browser.open`,
// `browser.close`, the two `browser.*` methods that never reach `callerScope`).
//
// The check that looks like it covers the terminal-content pair does not.
// `assertWorkspaceOwnsPty` takes its caller workspace from `params.workspaceId`
// (`input.rpc.ts`) and early-returns when it is absent, so it answers "do the
// named workspace and this pty agree" — never "is the named workspace the
// caller's". It is a consistency check; the binding is the missing half.
//
// ── What this module decides ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// For a HOSTED caller only, and only for the methods listed below:
//
//   omitted workspaceId   -> resolved to the binding, at dispatch. It already
//                            landed on the right workspace via the renderer
//                            fallback, but that fallback re-reads the active
//                            workspace LATER, so a switch between dispatch and
//                            handling resolved the call somewhere the caller
//                            was never bound to. Pinning it here closes that
//                            and makes the binding visible in what the handler
//                            receives instead of implicit in a re-read.
//   foreign workspaceId   -> READ: substituted with the binding.
//                            WRITE: refused.
//   unbound host (`null`) -> refused, both classes. The plugin host dispatched
//                            this and had no workspace to bind to; falling
//                            through would leave the caller free to name its
//                            own, making an unbound plugin strictly LESS
//                            confined than a bound one (PR1's fail-open).
//
// The read/write seam is the owner's ruling on #922, and it is read off the
// capability each method already declares (`CAPABILITY_EFFECT`), not off a
// verdict table written here. Reads substitute because the plugin still gets a
// truthful answer — about itself — which is what #959 chose for private events
// and what keeps an approved plugin working instead of erroring mid-poll.
// Writes refuse because silently redirecting an action does not fail safe: it
// would create a pane, or open a surface, in a workspace nobody asked for.
//
// ── Scope, stated so the gaps are not read as oversights ─────────────────
//
// WIRE callers are untouched. Every decision here is keyed on
// `isHostedCaller`, which is true only for the in-process plugin host, so the
// `declared` and `legacy` lanes behave exactly as before — they still need the
// peer-credential primitive #922 tracks, and this does not supply it.
//
// The mode switch (`mcp.mode`) is deliberately NOT consulted. It is the
// rollback lever for the #810 browser scope TABLE, which changed how existing
// wire callers resolve; the hosted binding is a different caller class that
// nothing was relying on, and the two other places that already scope on it
// (`events.rpc.ts`, `a2a.channel.rpc.ts`, both #959) do not consult it either.
// Gating here would also make dev builds (where shadow is the default) behave
// differently from the packaged builds plugin authors ship against.
//
// Ceiling, unchanged from PR1 and #959: this confines an APPROVED plugin to
// the scope its approval implied. It is not a defence against hostile code
// already running as the user.

/**
 * Methods that resolve a workspace out of the request body with no ownership
 * check of their own. Two bypass patterns feed this set, and the second was
 * missed on the first pass because the survey only looked for the first:
 *
 *   1. the renderer fallback — `params.workspaceId ?? store.activeWorkspaceId`
 *      in `useRpcBridge.ts`, which resolves inside whatever workspace the
 *      caller named;
 *   2. the SKIPPED ownership check — `assertWorkspaceOwnsPty` (`ptyOwnership.ts`)
 *      and `resolveTarget` (`pane.rpc.ts`) both early-return when
 *      `workspaceId` is absent, so a caller that names a foreign `ptyId` or
 *      `paneId` and NO workspace is not checked at all. Omitting the field was
 *      the bypass; that is why every method here has `workspaceId` pinned on
 *      omission rather than only on mismatch.
 *
 * `hostedWorkspaceBinding.drift.test.ts` scans the tree for both patterns and
 * fails when a plugin-reachable method carries one without appearing here.
 *
 * Deliberately out, having been checked:
 *
 *   `surface.list` / `surface.new`  — `wmux.internal`; no plugin can declare
 *                                     the reserved prefix, so unreachable.
 *   `pane.resolveActiveLeaf`        — a main->renderer channel with no router
 *                                     entry; not in the `RpcMethod` union.
 *   `pane.focus` / `pane.close` /   — no `workspaceId` param at all; they take
 *   `pane.stash` / `pane.unstash`     a globally-unique `paneId`. They are
 *                                     confined through `hostedConfinement`
 *                                     below instead, reusing the renderer's
 *                                     commander-confinement path.
 *
 * Everything ELSE stays out on purpose. `browser.*` beyond the two below
 * resolves its scope in `callerScope` (#941) and must keep doing so — a second
 * binding applied here would double-scope it under a different mode policy.
 * `events.poll` and `a2a.channel.*` resolve theirs in-handler (#959) with
 * per-event-class semantics that a blanket `workspaceId` injection would
 * quietly narrow: their LIFECYCLE half is an all-workspace firehose for every
 * subscriber by design, and pinning the param would turn that into a filter.
 *
 * Being a set rather than "every method" is also the conservative half of the
 * open question in the #922 design pass: `workspaceId` reads as caller scope
 * at every site surveyed, but that was not proven for the whole method space,
 * and a security boundary is the wrong place to assume it.
