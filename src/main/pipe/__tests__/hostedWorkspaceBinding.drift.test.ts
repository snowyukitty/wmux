// #922 PR2 — coverage drift guard.
//
// The first pass at this work surveyed ONE bypass pattern (the renderer's
// `params.workspaceId ?? store.activeWorkspaceId` fallback) and shipped a
// covered set built from that survey. It missed a second, larger pattern
// entirely: `assertWorkspaceOwnsPty` and `resolveTarget` both early-return
// when `workspaceId` is absent, so omitting the field skipped the check rather
// than failing it — `input.send` could write to a foreign terminal and
// `pane.getMetadata` could read a foreign pane's metadata, neither of which
// the first survey looked at.
//
// A test that re-lists the covered set cannot catch that; it only restates the
// author's belief. This one reads the TREE instead, finds every method that
// carries either pattern, and fails when a plugin-reachable one is not covered.
// A new method with a familiar bypass now fails here rather than shipping.
