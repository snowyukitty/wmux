// ─── Fan-out runaway brakes: lineage mark, global caps, audit log ───────────
//
// Fan-out over the pipe runs without a human approval by default (owner
// decision 2026-09-24), so three main-side records take over the job the
// dialog used to do as a side effect:
//
//   lineage — every task workspace is stamped with the workspace that fanned
//             it out, BEFORE its agent launches. A caller whose workspace
//             carries a stamp cannot fan out again (depth-1), whatever its
//             ledger row says. A workspace a stamped caller creates inherits
//             the stamp.
//   caps    — at most FANOUT_LIVE_TASK_CAP live tasks and
//             FANOUT_HOURLY_TASK_CAP started tasks per rolling hour, app-wide.
//             Checked and reserved synchronously at claim time; over a cap the
//             call is refused (no dialog, so nothing queues up behind it).
//   audit   — one jsonl line per fan-out that is about to run: who, where,
//             what (prompt hashes, not bodies), and whether a person approved;
//             then one line with what each task actually launched.
//
// Threat model: these are brakes against loops and accidental amplification on
// the HONEST paths, not a defence against hostile local code — anything
// running as the user can edit these files or call `claude` directly. They are
// built to be correct and fail closed where the answer is uncertain (an
// unreadable lineage store refuses the fan-out, a torn caps file counts as a
// full hour), not to be spoof-proof.
//
// Storage sits beside the task ledger in the WMUX_DATA_SUFFIX-scoped wmux dir.
