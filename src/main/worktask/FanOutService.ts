## How your next instructions arrive (wmux)

You are running in a wmux pane. When this task is done and you go idle:

- A **task sent to you** (\`send_message\`) IS pasted into your prompt — it starts a new turn on its own.
- A **channel mention that pins your pane** is pasted the same way, at your next idle moment.
- A channel post that mentions only your *workspace* — or that mentions nobody — is **not** pasted. It raises an unread badge and nothing else.

So going idle is not "waiting for the next message": nothing wakes you for the third case. If you are expecting follow-up work, check \`channel_unread\` / \`a2a_task_query\` yourself before you stop. And report completion in your mission channel (\`channel_post\`) — an idle worker and a hung worker look identical from the outside, and the only difference the sender can see is what you said.

## How completion is recorded (task ledger)

Your task has a row in the task ledger; the brain reads that row, not your prose. A natural-language "done" is **not** completion.

- When the task is done **and your own gate passed** (tsc / lint / tests for what you touched): \`ledger_update({task_id, status: "review_requested", expected_rev, summary})\` — the summary says what landed and what you verified.
- On a blocker you cannot clear yourself: \`ledger_update({task_id, status: "input_required", expected_rev, summary})\` — the summary names what you need.
- \`expected_rev\` is the rev you last read (1 right after fan-out); a stale rev is refused, so re-read and retry. Only the brain can mark \`completed\`.

/**
 * #1490 — the PowerShell pipeline stage that turns the prompt file's text into
 * the string PowerShell hands to the agent as ONE intact argv entry.
 *
 * Windows PowerShell 5.1 (and 7.x with `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` unset
 * or `Legacy`) builds a native command line without escaping embedded `"`: it
 * wraps the value in quotes only when it finds whitespace at an even count of
 * `"` characters, and passes it verbatim otherwise. A prompt such as
 * `Fix the "login page" bug` therefore reached the agent split at the inner
 * quotes, and everything after the first piece — the wmux preamble included —
 * was lost.
 *
 * The two legacy binders count quotes differently, so each gets its own escape
 * (both verified against powershell.exe 5.1 and pwsh 7.6 in Legacy mode):
 *  - 5.1 counts every `"`, escaped or not, so a `\"` escape flips the parity and
 *    the value goes out unwrapped. The stage quotes the value itself: `"…"`
 *    around it, each `"` inside written as `""` (the C runtime's in-quotes
 *    escape — two quote characters, so the parity never changes and 5.1 never
 *    adds a second pair). Backslashes in front of a quote, and at the end of
 *    the value, are doubled.
 *  - 6+ skips a `"` that follows a backslash, which breaks `""` after a
 *    backslash but makes the usual `\"` escape safe: no escaped quote is
 *    counted, so the binder wraps the value itself — and doubles its trailing
 *    backslashes itself, so only the ones in front of a quote are doubled here.
 * 7.3+ in `Standard` or `Windows` mode escapes arguments correctly on its own,
 * so the text passes through untouched there. 6.0–7.2 have only the legacy
 * binder and are assumed to match 7.6's Legacy mode; they were not run. The
 * variable is read with Get-Variable because 5.1 does not define it and a
 * profile's Set-StrictMode would make a bare `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing`
 * throw — the worker would not launch at all. The quote character is
 * spelled `[char]34` / `\x22` so the whole `"$(…)"` stays one quoted word for
 * the launch-line tokenizers (workerLaunch.spans, agentResume.tokenize). `\z`,
 * not `$`: `$` also matches before a final newline.
 *
 * Known gap: 7.3+ `Windows` mode still uses the legacy rules for `.cmd`/`.bat`
 * launchers (an npm shim without its `.ps1`), and the text passes through
 * unescaped there.

 * exactly as exposed as before. The renderer decides that instead, where the
 * binding actually resolves: it splits the marker off before the role rewrite
