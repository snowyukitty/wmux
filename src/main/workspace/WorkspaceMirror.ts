// WorkspaceMirror — a main-process cache of the renderer's workspace tree +
// per-pane agent status, populated by renderer push (IPC.WORKSPACE_MIRROR_PUSH).
//
// WHY: today `workspace.list` is a main→renderer round-trip (workspace.rpc.ts →
// useRpcBridge.ts). Hook signals fire far more often than the workspace tree
// changes, and a large-buffer flush storm can starve that round-trip until the
// bridge's 2s cap trips (see hooks.rpc.ts WORKSPACE_LIST_CACHE_TTL_MS). The
// mirror lets main serve the last renderer-pushed snapshot locally instead —
// no renderer dependency on the hot path.
//
// CONTRACT: routing/snapshot-only. The mirror is NEVER read by the renderer/UI
// and is never authoritative for focus. Full-snapshot replacement (last write
// wins) — the renderer always pushes the complete tree, so there is nothing to
// reconcile. `now` is injectable so the staleness math is unit-testable.
