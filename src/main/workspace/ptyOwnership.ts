// ptyOwnership — mirror-first resolution of "which workspace owns this PTY"
// (and its D2 role binding) for main-process RPC handlers.
//
// WHY: every external MCP call used to pay a main→renderer round-trip
// (`input.findOwnerWorkspace`) per ownership check / identity resolution /
// role-binding lookup — 1-3 round-trips per call, and the renderer answers
// late exactly when the app is busy (flush storm), which is the moment the
// latency hurts. Main already holds a renderer-pushed WorkspaceMirror
// (structural changes push immediately, status churn debounced 300ms, 30s
// periodic — see useWorkspaceMirrorPush.ts), so a fresh mirror can answer
// locally and the round-trip becomes the fallback, not the hot path.
//
// TRUST MODEL (documented for PR review):
//   - The mirror and the round-trip have the SAME source of truth (the
//     renderer store); the mirror is just earlier. The exposure is bounded to
//     pushes lost/delayed within STALE_TRUST_MS (10s) after a pane moved
//     workspaces — structural changes push immediately, so the realistic
//     window is IPC delivery latency (ms).
//   - assert-style checks (expected workspace known): the mirror can only
//     SHORT-CIRCUIT AN ALLOW when it AGREES with the expectation. Any miss /
//     stale / disagreement falls back to the round-trip, which remains the
//     sole DENY authority — a stale mirror can never produce a false reject.
//   - resolve-style checks (caller identity from a verified senderPtyId): the
//     senderPtyId anchor is ADVISORY attribution under the #113 same-user
//     ceiling by design (see events.rpc.ts resolveCallerWorkspace — the true
//     unforgeable fix is peer-PID, deferred). A ≤10s-stale answer does not
//     change that threat model. Misses still round-trip, and the fail-closed
//     '' contract at the call sites is preserved.
//   - task-owner lane (fan-out T5, `assertCallerMayAccessPty`): a pane in a
//     workspace that is an OPEN ledger task of the caller is reachable across
//     workspaces. The caller is who MAIN says it is — a validated commander
//     token, or the workspace main resolves the caller's walked ptyId to —
//     never `params.workspaceId`. Like the assert posture, the mirror may only
//     short-circuit the ALLOW (owner is one of the caller's task workspaces);
//     anything else round-trips before the deny. Any lookup failure denies.
//     A runaway brake for honest orchestrators, not a same-user boundary (#113):
//     the walked ptyId arrives as a request field, and main can only check
//     which workspace owns it, not that the caller is that pane.
