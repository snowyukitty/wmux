// B′ — session-preserving stale-daemon auto-replacement.
//
// Design: plans/daemon-auto-replace-plan-2026-07-05.md (v1.1, 3-model panel
// reviewed). The orchestration deliberately reuses the shipped machinery for
// everything destructive-adjacent: `daemon.shutdown` (the daemon's own
// suspend-everything RPC), the launcher's verified-kill guards, and the
// respawn controller's budget loop. What lives here is only the decision
// logic (is the daemon positively older?) and the step sequencing with its
// failure policy — both pure enough to unit-test without a live daemon
// (`tryEscalatedReping` precedent: every effect is injected).
//
// Failure policy, one line: destructive escalation (SIGKILL) only after the
// shutdown ack, only against the PID captured at ack time, and only when the
// image+cmdline verification is DEFINITIVE. Every pre-ack failure falls back
// to "reuse the old daemon" (today's behavior); every post-ack failure falls
// back to the respawn-budget machinery — never to installing a dead client.

import type { ProcessLiveness } from '../../shared/processLiveness';

// Must stay BELOW the daemon's own 10s shutdown hard-timeout
// (daemon/index.ts shutdown() guard). If this budget exceeded 10s, the
// "timeout" branch would always mean "the daemon already exit(1)ed" — and
// reusing that client would install a dead socket the health probe never
// escalates on (it early-returns when !isConnected), permanently wedging the
// app in a fake-connected state (Codex #3 + Claude #1). At 8s a timed-out
// daemon is guaranteed still alive (hung mid-shutdown), so the reuse branch
// is sound: when it self-destructs at 10s, the by-then-installed disconnect
// listener hands off to the normal respawn machinery.

/**
 * Issue #545 — has the old daemon finished shutting down?
 *
 * `tasklist` is the only death signal today, and by deliberate design
 * (`processLiveness`, Defect-1 / split-brain) a probe that fails or times out
 * returns `unknown`, NEVER `dead`. On a box where tasklist is slow or
 * AV-blocked, EVERY poll returns `unknown`, so a daemon that acked cleanly and
 * exited 10 ms later still burns the full 5 s budget, then fails the
 * `definitiveOnly` kill (its image lookup is null for the same reason), and the
 * whole replacement dead-ends. That matches the reported "dead=false after
 * graceful poll 5s, every run" far better than an actually-lingering process
 * does — measured post-ack exit is 7-12 ms (node and Electron, 10 and 35
 * sessions).
 *
 * So accept a second, independent proof:
 *
 *   liveness === 'dead'                       ─► confirmed (authoritative)
 *   liveness === 'unknown' && acked && pipeGone ─► confirmed (shutdown completed)
 *   anything else                             ─► not confirmed (keep polling)
 *
 * Two preconditions, both load-bearing:
 *
 *  - `acked`: without an ack we never learned the daemon committed to dying, so
 *    a pipe that merely looks gone must not authorize spawning over it.
 *  - `liveness !== 'alive'`: a process the probe POSITIVELY sees running has not
 *    finished exiting, whatever its pipe says — it is mid-shutdown. Only
 *    `unknown` (we learned nothing) gets rescued by the pipe signal. Spawning a
 *    second daemon next to a confirmed-live one is the split-brain hazard this
 *    whole file exists to prevent, and the existing SIGKILL escalation already
 *    covers a daemon that genuinely lingers.
 *
 * NAMING: this proves "shutdown() ran to completion", not "the process left the
 * process table" — `pipeServer.stop()` happens before the exit. That is still
 * exactly what the caller needs, because by then `releaseLock()` has run and
 * `disposeAll()` has killed the PTYs, so the lock and the pipe name are free
 * for a fresh daemon. Named for what it proves so it is never reused as a
 * liveness oracle.
