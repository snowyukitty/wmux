/**
 * Windows install teardown (#866).
 *
 * Squirrel's `Setup.exe` is a first-install program, not an updater: its first
 * action is a recursive delete of the whole install root ("burning it to the
 * ground" in its own log). Today `performInstall` launches it and only THEN
 * calls `app.quit()`, so the delete starts while our processes still have the
 * install root open. The delete throws, the exception escapes
 * `Squirrel.Update.Program.Install`, and the install aborts with the root
 * already half-deleted: no Update.exe, no stub, no launcher to retry from.
 *
 * This is not a race that a faster quit could win. Measured on a live install:
 *
 *   - `app.quit()` takes the DETACH branch (index.ts before-quit), which keeps
 *     the daemon running BY DESIGN — that is the persistence promise.
 *   - the daemon's own process image is `<root>\app-X.Y.Z\wmux.exe`, and a
 *     running image cannot be unlinked on Windows.
 *   - killing only the GUI left `DAEMON + 3 MCP servers` alive and the exe
 *     still reporting "being used by another process".
 *
 * So the install has to start against a genuinely dead tree. This module owns
 * that: enumerate everything running out of the install root, take it down,
 * and hand off to a detached waiter that starts Setup.exe only after every
 * process is confirmed gone AND the root is confirmed unlocked.
 *

 *          │
 *          ├─ WaitForExit on a HANDLE captured per pid, not a pid poll.
 *          │  A pid poll is wrong twice over: Windows recycles pids, and a
 *          │  recycled pid reads as "still alive" forever.
 *          │
 *          ├─ then probe the root for locks. Killing a snapshot of pids does
 *          │  NOT stop the MCP hosts (claude.exe and friends) from spawning a
 *          │  fresh server into the directory we are about to delete — that is
 *          │  a TOCTOU window the pid list cannot close.
 *          │
 *          ├─ still locked after the budget? ABORT — never launch Setup.exe
 *          │  against a live tree. Aborting leaves the user on a working old

 *          │
 *          └─ clear? start Setup.exe.

 * #1136 — the VBScript launcher for the hidden waiter transport.
 *
 * Root cause it exists for, measured on this box (Win11 26200, default
 * terminal = "Let Windows decide" → Windows Terminal): libuv turns
 * `windowsHide: true` into `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, but `detached: true` also sets
 * `DETACHED_PROCESS` — and the two are mutually exclusive console-creation
 * flags, so `DETACHED_PROCESS` wins. The console child then allocates its own
 * console, that allocation goes through the Win11 default-terminal delegation,
 * and Windows Terminal opens a real, visible window. Proven by A/B: the SAME
 * `cmd.exe`, same `windowsHide: true`, produced a visible `WindowsTerminal`
 * window with `detached: true` and none without it. So this is specific to the
 * detached waiter transports; the module's non-detached `execFileSync` calls
 * (probeVolume, terminatePids) are unaffected and are left alone.
 *
 * `wscript.exe` is a GUI-subsystem host: it never allocates a console, so
 * nothing reaches the delegation layer. It then starts PowerShell through
 * `WshShell.Run(cmd, 0, True)`:
 *   - window style 0 = hidden, and because wscript already owns no console the
 *     child's console is created hidden rather than delegated,
 *   - `bWaitOnReturn = True` keeps wscript parked as the waiter's parent for
 *     its whole life. That is deliberate and NOT a cost regression: it is the
 *     same shape as the cmd.exe trampoline it replaces (one idle host process),
 *     and it is what keeps the refusal path's `taskkill /T` able to reach the
 *     PowerShell child. With `False` the launcher would exit immediately and
 *     orphan a waiter no tree-kill could find.
 *
 * VBScript string literals are double-quoted with `""` as the escape, so an
 * apostrophe in TEMP (the `O'Brien` case the cmd transport is pinned on) is
 * inert here. A literal `"` cannot occur in a Windows path, but rather than
 * rely on that this returns null for one — same fail-closed rule as

 * #1264 — the Task Scheduler transport's command line.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE this exists for. Every transport below (W/A/B) reaches the waiter
 * by `child_process.spawn` from the Electron main process, and on Windows that
 * makes the waiter a MEMBER OF WHATEVER JOB OBJECT THE APP IS IN. libuv never
 * passes `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` (its own win/process.c comment says so),
 * and `detached: true` only buys DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP —
 * neither of which leaves a job. A job created with
 * `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` terminates every member the moment its
 * last handle closes, i.e. exactly when wmux's last process exits. The
 * `wscript` hop does not help: it is spawned the same way, so the whole
 * trampoline is inside the job with the PowerShell it hosts.
 *
 * That is precisely the reported signature: `update-install-ready.tmp` =
 * `alive` and `launched-w.txt` = `launched` (the waiter's first two lines ran),
 * then nothing — no marker overwrite from ANY of the script's own exit
 * branches, and no Setup.exe. A process that is killed by the kernel cannot
 * reach a branch.
 *
 * The fix is to stop being the parent. `schtasks /Create` + `schtasks /Run`
 * makes the Task Scheduler service start the process: it is not our child, not
 * in our job, and not in any tree a `taskkill /T` of ours can walk. No admin
 * rights are needed for a per-user task, and no password is needed because the
 * task is left to run as the logged-on interactive user.
 *
 * The command still goes through `wscript.exe` rather than straight to
 * PowerShell: Task Scheduler starts an interactive-user task with a normal
 * console, so a console-subsystem child would flash the very window #1136
 * removed. wscript is GUI-subsystem and starts PowerShell hidden.
 *
 * The definition is registered from XML rather than the `/TR` short form, and
 * that is load-bearing rather than tidy — see buildScheduledTaskXml for the
 * power settings `/TR` cannot express and for why the task carries no trigger.

 * `DisallowStartIfOnBatteries=true` and `StopIfGoingOnBatteries=true`. On a

 * transport W, the one that cannot survive the job), and unplugging mid-wait
 * makes the scheduler TERMINATE the waiter — a silent kill wearing the
 * pessimistic marker, i.e. #1264 again. `/TR` cannot express those settings;
 * only `/XML` (or COM) can. So the settings below are not decoration, they are
 * the correctness of the transport:
 *
 *   DisallowStartIfOnBatteries=false  — start on battery,
 *   StopIfGoingOnBatteries=false      — do not kill it when the plug is pulled,
 *   AllowHardTerminate=false          — the scheduler may not hard-kill it,
 *   ExecutionTimeLimit=PT0S           — no time limit (the waiter's own budgets
 *                                       are the bound; PT72H would be a second,
 *                                       invisible deadline),
 *   MultipleInstancesPolicy=IgnoreNew — belt to the waiter's own root mutex,
 *   AllowStartOnDemand=true           — /Run is the ONLY way this task starts.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `<Triggers>` element. The `/TR` form needed
 * `/SC ONCE /ST <time>`, which meant a registration that leaked (a `/Create`
 * that timed out after the server committed, a `/Delete` that failed) would
 * FIRE ON ITS OWN later the same day — and a late waiter opens the recorded
 * pids by NUMBER, so after pid recycling it would `taskkill /T /F` strangers,
 * possibly relaunch Setup.exe out of %TEMP%, and write a false "install root
 * still locked" marker against an already-updated install. An on-demand-only
 * task cannot fire by itself at all, which removes that failure mode rather
 * than making it rare. The startup sweep below is the second half.
 *
 * The element ORDER matches what `schtasks /Query /XML` itself emits: the
 * importer validates against a sequence, and a definition that does not
 * round-trip is refused. A refusal here is not dangerous — it fails closed to
 * transport W exactly like every other S bail-out — but it would silently cost
 * the fix, so the order is pinned by a test.
 *
 * `runLevel` mirrors the CURRENT process. #1283 review: with a hardcoded
 * LeastPrivilege, a wmux that was started elevated would hand the install to a
 * medium-IL waiter whose `taskkill` against the elevated app pids fails — the

// #1136 adds W ahead of both. Same generosity as A, and for the same reason:
// its critical path is a wscript host start plus the same PS 5.1 cold start
// and AMSI scan of a freshly written .ps1. Measured on a Win11 box with
// Windows Terminal as the default host, W stamps in ~440ms (A: ~585ms), so
// the budget is >10x the observed cost; it is only ever spent in full on a
// machine where WSH is disabled by policy, and there `//B` makes wscript fail
// fast and silently rather than pop a dialog. Worst case is now three burned
// windows (~14s) before the refusal instead of two (~8s) — paid only on the
// path that was already going to end in a refusal dialog, and nothing is
// armed yet (the 20s before-quit deadline starts at app.quit()).
// #1264 — S gets the same window as W: its extra hop is a scheduler-service
// process start, and the expensive part (wscript host + PS 5.1 cold start +
// AMSI scan) is identical. #1283 review: the FIRST draft spent 10s each on the
// create, the run, the stamp and the delete, which put up to ~40s of
// synchronous main-process blocking in front of a user who had just clicked
// Install, on top of W/A/B's existing ~14s. schtasks is a LOCAL RPC — it
// answers in milliseconds or it is broken — so the calls get short timeouts and

 * install rather than fall back to launching Setup.exe directly.
 *
 * #1056 — "started" is not something a spawn can promise here. On current
 * Windows builds (measured on two real machines: the reporter's and this
 * one), a PowerShell spawned DIRECTLY with `detached: true` dies before
 * executing its first line — engine event 40961 with no 40962, exit 0,
 * nothing on stderr, no AV detection — while the same PowerShell created by
 * a detached cmd.exe survives and runs to completion. So:
 *
 *   transport S — #1264, PREFERRED. A one-shot Task Scheduler entry, started
 *       with `schtasks /Run`. The only transport whose process is NOT our
 *       child: the scheduler service starts it, so it is outside our job
 *       object and outside every tree our own `taskkill /T` can walk. It is
 *       the fix for "the waiter stamped `alive` and then died the instant the
 *       app exited" — see buildScheduledTaskCreateArgs.
 *   transport W — #1136. wscript.exe (GUI subsystem, so it never
 *       touches the Win11 default-terminal delegation that made the cmd.exe
 *       trampoline flash a visible Windows Terminal window) running a VBS
 *       one-liner that starts the same PowerShell hidden and waits on it.
 *       See buildWaiterVbsLauncher for the measured root cause.
 *   transport A — cmd.exe trampoline. argv-array: libuv does the CRT
 *       quoting, and cmd /c's strip-first-and-last-quote rule cannot fire
 *       because the first token after /c (the System32 powershell path)
 *       carries no spaces and is unquoted. Kept unchanged as the fallback for
 *       machines where Windows Script Host is disabled by policy — visible
 *       window and all, because a visible window is a cosmetic defect and a
 *       refused install is not.
 *   transport B — today's direct detached spawn, kept for machines where A
 *       is somehow unavailable but the direct spawn still works.
 *   Both with cwd pinned OUTSIDE the install root — an inherited cwd inside
 *       it would hold the directory open in a way the lock probe (file locks
 *       only) can never see.
 *
 * Each transport must PROVE execution: the waiter's first statement writes a
 * launch stamp — a distinct file per transport, so a late A stamp can never
 * be misattributed to B and the transport log cannot lie — and the gate
 * polls for it. The trampoline's cost is one idle cmd.exe parked as the
 * waiter's parent for its lifetime (up to ~11 min); it lives in System32 and
 * holds nothing under the install root.
