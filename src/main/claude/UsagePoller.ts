// Anthropic 5h/7d usage poller. Wraps loadClaudeCredential + fetchUsage
// behind a lifecycle the main process can start/stop/refresh on demand.
//
// Cadence: 15 min default. The usage endpoint is a read that spends no
// model quota, so a tighter cadence is cheap. Configurable via constructor injection so tests can run on millisecond
// scales. The poller is opt-in — the user must flip the Settings toggle
// before `start()` is called. While off, this module does ZERO disk
// reads and ZERO network requests.
//
// Failure handling:
//   - Credential not found (Claude Code not logged in) → emit
//     'token-missing' status, do not retry until `refreshNow()` is
//     called or the credential file is observed to appear (future
//     follow-up — for now manual refresh is the recovery).
//   - 401/403 (token expired or revoked) → emit 'unauthorized' status
//     and remember the token that was rejected. The interval KEEPS
//     RUNNING, on a shorter cadence, but a tick that reads back that
//     same rejected token returns before the network call — so we
//     never re-send a credential we already know is bad, and the
//     status clears by itself as soon as Claude Code writes a new one
//     (a re-login, or its own token refresh). That skip also expires
//     after `intervalMs`, so a 401 that was never about the token at
//     all still gets one retry per poll period — the same traffic a
//     healthy poller spends, and never more. Stopping the interval
//     outright was the old behaviour, and it left the widget reading
//     "Token expired" forever after a successful re-login (#1012).
//   - Network / 5xx → emit 'network-error' / 'http-error' with the
//     last error. The interval KEEPS RUNNING; next tick is the retry.
//     Avoids the failure mode where a transient outage permanently
//     darkens the StatusBar widget.
//   - 429 → emit 'http-error' and back off: automatic ticks are skipped
//     until Retry-After has passed, or, without one, for an exponential
//     delay (5, 10, 20, 40 min…) capped at 60 min. A success resets it.
//
// Window visibility: `setWindowVisible(isVisible)` lets main hook the
// BrowserWindow `'show'` / `'hide'` events. When the window has been
// hidden ≥ 30 minutes, we skip the next poll tick to avoid burning the
// user's API quota for a UI nobody is looking at. The next `show`
// triggers an immediate catch-up fetch.
