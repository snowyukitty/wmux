 * Why this exists: an `agent.stop` wake used to reach the orchestrator with no
 * content at all — just "this pane stopped". The orchestrator's only way to
 * learn WHY it stopped was to `terminal_read` and read the rendered screen,
 * which is ambiguous: a proposal the agent printed ("shall I merge?") looks
 * exactly like text sitting in the input box. Orchestrators mis-read that twice
 * in one session, reported "still running" for a pane that was actually blocked
 * on a question, and pressed Enter expecting to submit a line that was never
 * there.
 *
 * The Stop hook already hands us `transcript_path` (hooks.rpc.ts stores it on
 * the resume binding), so the agent's own last words are available as
 * structured data. Reading them here means the wake event can carry the
 * question itself — the same treatment `pr.review_comment` already gives
 * reviewer text.
