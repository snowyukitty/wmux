// ─── Command Deck — durable human-request ownership ────────────────────────
//
// A direct message to the commander is explicit permission to carry that work
// through its delegated pane/A2A stages. Resting workspace autonomy may still
// be `off`; this record is the narrower, request-scoped opt-in that lets the
// event loop wake until the commander explicitly finalizes the work.
//
// One active item per workspace keeps the contract understandable. A new human
// message while work is active is appended as a follow-up instead of silently
// abandoning workers that are already running. The commander closes the record
// through `deck_complete_work`, after the server checks local workers and every
// A2A task observed during this work item.
//
// Permission is scoped to the app launch that was granted it. Each record is
// stamped with the current boot identity, and a record that survives a shutdown
// comes back PARKED (#733): it is still owned, still holds the Stop gate and is
// still shown to the human, but it no longer authorizes the orchestrator to act
// on its own. Only a new human turn re-arms it.
