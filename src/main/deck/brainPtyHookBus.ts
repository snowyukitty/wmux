// ─── Brain-pty hook bus — private hook lane for the interactive TUI brain ────
//
// ClaudePtyBrainAdapter runs the user's own `claude` binary as an INTERACTIVE
// TUI inside a daemon pty session. An interactive session has no SDK message
// stream, so the adapter's only structured turn signal is Claude Code's own
// hook system: the generated settings profile wires `Stop` / `SessionStart` to
// the bundled `wmux-bridge.mjs`, which speaks the SAME `hooks.signal` RPC the
// fleet's panes already use.
//
// Those signals must NOT reach the fleet machinery. A brain pty is not a
// worker pane: routing its `agent.stop` into HookSignalRouter would (a) fan a
// desktop notification for the orchestrator's own turn, and (b) push an
// `agent.lifecycle` event into the deck's CommanderEventCoalescer, which wakes
// the owning workspace's brain — the brain would wake ITSELF on every turn it
// finishes, an unbounded self-wake loop.
//
// So this module is a claim-first registry consulted at the very top of
// `hooks.signal` (before the daemon relay): a signal whose `ptyId` belongs to a
// live brain pty is delivered to that adapter and consumed. One tiny module
// with no Electron/daemon imports so the RPC handler can depend on it without
// pulling the adapter's spawn machinery into its module graph.
