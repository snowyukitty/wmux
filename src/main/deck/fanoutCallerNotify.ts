// ─── Fan-out worker event → the pane that started the fan-out ───────────────
//
// routeWorkerEventToOwner parks a worker event when the owner workspace has no
// brain (mode 'off', the default), so a pane agent that ran fanout_start was
// never told its workers finished. This is the accelerator beside that park:
// it hands the renderer a pointer — owner workspace, task, kind, seq, and the
// requester's stable pane/surface ids from the lineage stamp — and the
// renderer has one fixed line written into that pane if it can prove the pane
// is still there and idle (src/renderer/hooks/fanoutCallerNudge.ts).
//
// Two sources: a worker's agent turn end (stop / stop_failure, beside the
// park), and a worker moving its own ledger row to review_requested or failed
// — a worker that records `failed` in its last turn closes the row, so the
// Stop that follows is no longer routed or parked at all.
//
// No ack and no retry from here: the park stays the record. A pointer sent
// before the renderer subscribed (startup, reload) is lost by design; the park
// still holds the event. Fail-closed — any doubt about who asked means nothing
// is sent:
//   - the lineage stamp must name the same owner as the ledger,
//   - an owner that is itself a fan-out task (nested) is never addressed,
//   - only a 'pane' origin with at least one id (never gui / orchestrator),
//   - never a PTY id: the renderer re-resolves the ids against the owner's
//     live layout right before it writes,
//   - no window (headless) → nothing.
