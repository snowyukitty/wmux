// ─── Command Deck — binding operator policy channel (deck-policy.md) ─────────
//
// Unlike commanderMemory (framed as background context, NEVER instructions — the
// PRD §8 poisoning guard), THIS channel is the operator's OWN authoritative
// standing rules. The human wrote the file, so the brain may ACT on it: when a
// rule here settles a question the brain was about to escalate, it resolves the
// fork itself and cites the rule instead of halting on deck_ask_decision. This
// is the decide-vs-escalate boundary's binding half — the resolve-first
// procedure in the system prompt names "the [policy] block of this turn" as the
// first thing to check.
//
// The ceiling is stated IN the injected header and holds structurally: a rule
// cannot grant the brain new tools or override safety — a risky/irreversible
// action still requires a human decision, because the tool sandbox / disallowed
// list are untouched by this text. Policy only shifts what counts as a "fork
// only the human should settle"; it never widens the brain's hands.
//
// One file (`<wmuxDir>/deck-policy.md`), read fresh each turn (withLoopContext),
// fail-OPEN: missing/unreadable/empty → null (no block), never throws — a broken
// policy file must not break a live turn.
