// ─── Command Deck — level-review heartbeat (WP4) ─────────────────────────────
//
// The periodic safety net for a missed judgment. The event-push coalescer wakes
// a workspace's brain on pane EDGES (agent.stop / awaiting_input / pr.*); if an
// edge is ever dropped — a hook that never fired, an event lost during a busy
// window that then got consumed — the pane sits needing attention with nothing
// to surface it. This heartbeat re-reads the CURRENT level state of each armed
// workspace on a slow cadence and hands it to the coalescer's flushSnapshot,
// which wakes the brain through the SAME gate stack (decision → mode → rate →
// busy → budget). So the review can never wake MORE than the edge path would —
// it only catches what the edge path missed.
//
// Main-process, transport-free — same shape as DeckScheduler: a `flushSnapshot`
// callback plus probes and injectable clock/timer deps so tests drive it
// deterministically. The per-tick conditions below are an OPTIMIZATION (skip
// the obvious non-candidates cheaply); the coalescer's gates remain the
// authority on whether a wake actually fires.
