// ─── Command Deck — event-push coalescer (the one genuinely new piece) ───────
//
// Turns raw EventBus `agent.lifecycle` events (agent.stop / agent.awaiting_input)
// into AT MOST ONE orchestrator wake-turn per debounce window, per workspace.
// Pure state machine: no Electron, no EventBus, no SDK — it takes a `runTurn`
// callback + `isBusy`/`getAutonomy` probes + injectable timers so it unit-tests
// deterministically with fake clocks.
//
// Design lock: plans/orchestrator-event-push-2026-07-12.md. The load-bearing
// rules folded in here:
//
//   1. LOOP GUARD = turn budget, NOT event suppression. We NEVER hide a
//      lifecycle event from the brain (the stop it's waiting for must reach it).
//      Runaway is bounded by a per-workspace budget of CONSECUTIVE auto-wakes
//      that resets on human input (notifyHumanSend).
//   2. AUTONOMY is fail-closed: without the approvalPress capability every
//      awaiting_input is stamped NOTIFY ONLY. With it, a hook-source event may
//      be pressed directly; a `detector`-source (regex) event must be VERIFIED
//      on screen (terminal_read) before pressing — regexes can false-positive
//      (owner decision 2026-07-17). Enforced in buildEventPrompt.
//   3. COALESCING is an explicit state machine keyed by ptyId, preserving the
//      last event PER KIND (a stop AND a later awaiting_input for the same pane
//      both survive the flush).
//   4. onIdle flushes on a LATER TICK (the manager defers its onIdle), so a
//      flush never re-enters send() on the unwinding turn stack. A busy reject
//      requeues (buffer retained) rather than dropping the loser.
//   5. Events go into the prompt as an UNTRUSTED, structured, fenced block so
//      pane output can't be read as instructions (prompt injection).
//   6. IDEMPOTENCY via a per-workspace seq watermark: an event whose seq we've
//      already flushed is dropped, and every surfaced line carries its seq so
//      the brain can dedup a pushed event against its own poll cursor.
//   7. RATE CEILING (unconditional) = a sliding-window cap of `maxWakesPerMin`
//      ACCEPTED wakes per workspace, pruned over a 60s window. It sits ABOVE the
//      consecutive budget and — unlike the budget — a running loop does NOT lift
//      it: the loop's `iterations` replace the CONSECUTIVE cap (frequency of a
//      burst), but a runaway hook/detector storm must never turn the brain into
//      a busy-loop. Over the ceiling we retain the buffer and re-arm a belt timer
//      that retries exactly when the window next slides. A wake counts against the
//      ceiling only when it is ACCEPTED (same point autoWakesUsed increments) —
//      snapshot flushes count too.
//   8. LEVEL-SNAPSHOT flush (flushSnapshot) is the missed-judgment safety net for
//      the WP4 heartbeat: it re-reads CURRENT per-pane state (a FleetSnapshot) and
//      wakes through the SAME gate stack (decision/switch/mode/rate/budget/busy) so
//      a pane whose edge was lost is still surfaced. It is edge-equivalent for
//      accounting (budget + rate) but drops cleanly on a busy reject — the next
//      heartbeat re-reads level state — while any co-buffered EDGES survive that
//      busy reject exactly as an edge flush would.
//
// NOT YET here (follow-ups, noted in the plan): `drove-by-you-at` per-pane wake
// reason annotation (needs brain tool-target tracking), buffered-event
// persistence across reload, and the per-turn action fan-out cap (bounds
// actions WITHIN a wake; the budget bounds wake FREQUENCY).

 *     carries its own verdict because nothing finished, and it survives the
 *     `value-filtered` (assist) filter that drops a plain stop as summary spam.
 *   - pr.ci_failed — this workspace's PR checks flipped to FAILING (AO-style
 *     CI feedback routing, owner decision 2026-07-18). Edge-triggered by the
 *     metadata poll (PrCiRouter): fires ONCE on the passing/pending→failing
 *     transition, never repeatedly while red. Woken so the brain can drive the
 *     owning pane to a fix (gated by continueInstruction, exactly like a stop).
 *   - pr.review_comment — NEW review feedback landed on this pane's PR
 *     (PrReviewRouter, watermarked batch — slice 2 of the same decision).
 *     Same wake + drive gating as pr.ci_failed.
 *   - pr.merge_conflict — this pane's PR went CONFLICTING against its base
 *     (slice 3, same router's throttled read). Same wake + drive gating.
