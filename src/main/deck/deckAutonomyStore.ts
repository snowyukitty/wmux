// ─── Command Deck — per-workspace autonomy capabilities (event-push) ─────────
//
// The event-push loop lets a pane lifecycle change (agent.stop /
// agent.awaiting_input) WAKE a workspace's orchestrator into a fresh turn. What
// that turn is ALLOWED to do is gated here, per workspace, fail-closed.
//
// Three capabilities, from harmless to dangerous (decision 2 of
// plans/orchestrator-event-push-2026-07-12.md):
//   - summarize            (default ON)  — open a turn that reports state and
//                                          stops. Cannot touch a pane.
//   - continueInstruction  (default OFF) — the brain may send a follow-up
//                                          instruction into a pane.
//   - approvalPress        (default OFF) — the brain may press y/1/2/3 on an
//                                          approval prompt.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED: a missing/corrupt file, an unknown workspace, or a torn entry
// all resolve to DEFAULT_AUTONOMY (summarize on, the two dangerous caps off).
// This mirrors channelsTabVisible (#413): the safe posture is the one you fall
// back to when anything is uncertain.
//
// APPROVAL RULE ENFORCED ELSEWHERE (CommanderEventCoalescer): with approvalPress
// on, a hook-source awaiting_input may be pressed directly; a `detector`-source
// (regex) one must be VERIFIED on screen first (terminal_read) before pressing
// (owner decision 2026-07-17 — detector events are the only awaiting_input
// source, so a hook-only rule made approval-press dead code). This store only
// says whether the CAPABILITY is on; the coalescer's prompt builder carries the
// verify-then-press instruction.
//
// One JSON file (`deck-autonomy.json`) in the wmux data dir, atomic-written and
// WMUX_DATA_SUFFIX-isolated — the same storage shape as deck-schedules.json /
// deck-commander.json.

// ─── Agent mode (per-workspace, owner design 2026-07-13, revised 2026-08-01) ──
//
// The user-facing control, and the answer to ONE question: HOW is the terminal
// brain's `claude` launched for this workspace?
//
//   off      the terminal brain does not run at all. Nothing spawns, and the
//            deck composer is disabled — there is nobody to type to. The
//            handler ALSO tears down running loops + disables cadence
//            schedules (kill switch).
//   assist   launch Claude in AUTO mode — `--permission-mode acceptEdits`.
//            It edits without asking, but every other permission prompt still
//            stops it.
//   danger   launch Claude in BYPASS mode — `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
//            Nothing prompts. (This is the mode formerly called `auto`; the
//            rename is what turned the knob from a wake policy into a launch
//            policy.)
//
// WAKE POLICY IS A SEPARATE AXIS (2026-08-01). It used to be derived from the
// mode, which conflated two unrelated questions — "how much may this brain do
// without asking" and "what should wake it". They are now stored side by side:
// `wakePolicy` lives on the entry and is what the coalescer reads. modeToWakePolicy
// survives only to seed it (see below).
//
//   wake policy:  'none' | 'value-filtered' | 'all'
//   (a RUNNING loop overrides to 'all' regardless of the stored policy,
//    mirroring the global auto-wake switch's loop carve-out.)
//
// Legacy mode values are mapped on read (sanitizeEntry): 'manual' → 'off',
// and both 'orchestrate' (four-mode era) and 'auto' (the pre-rename danger
// mode) → 'danger'.
