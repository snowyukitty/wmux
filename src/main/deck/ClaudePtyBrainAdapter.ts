// ─── ClaudePtyBrainAdapter — the interactive Claude Code TUI as a brain ──────
//
// Vendor id: `claude-pty`. A hedge against the headless `claude -p` / Agent SDK
// path becoming metered: the mode that is unambiguously covered by a Claude
// subscription is the INTERACTIVE TUI. So this adapter runs the user's own
// `claude` binary as a real terminal program inside a daemon pty session and
// drives it by typing, exactly as a human would.
//
// Three decisions shape everything below (all validated by the 2026-07-26 PoC):
//
//  1. NO OUTPUT PARSING. A TUI's screen is a rendering, not a protocol. Every
//     structured fact this adapter needs — turn boundaries, the session id, the
//     final assistant text — comes from Claude Code's HOOK system instead, via
//     the bundled `wmux-bridge.mjs` the fleet already uses. The one exception is
//     a single stale-resume substring probe on the spawn banner (see
//     STALE_RESUME_MARKER), which is a startup soft-fail, not turn state.
//
//  2. THE TUI *IS* THE CONVERSATION VIEW. The deck embeds this pty (a terminal
//     attached by ptyId) instead of re-synthesising streamed bubbles, so there
//     is deliberately no `text-delta` streaming here: one final `text-delta`
//     plus one `turn-end` per turn, read off the transcript.
//
//  3. THE SPAWN ENV MUST BE SCRUBBED. Inheriting main's `CLAUDE*` environment
//     into a nested claude (notably CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION) silently turns
//     transcript persistence OFF — which kills both the Stop hook's
//     `transcript_path` and `--resume`. See scrubBrainSpawnEnv.
//
// Contract: BrainAdapter, with the CommanderSessionManager lifecycle — exactly
// one `turn-end` per clean turn, a live `sessionId` getter, and a dispose() that
// terminates an in-flight iterator instead of hanging it.
