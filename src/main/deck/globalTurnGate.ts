// ─── Command Deck — global concurrent-turn gate ──────────────────────────────
//
// A tiny counting semaphore capping how many AUTONOMOUS brain turns may be in
// flight ACROSS all workspaces at once. Each workspace's CommanderSessionManager
// is already one-turn-at-a-time on its OWN thread, but with many workspaces a
// hook/detector storm (or a fleet of running loops) can wake several brains at
// the same instant — N parallel SDK subprocesses each burning tokens and CPU.
// This gate is the fleet-wide ceiling that chokes that at the single autonomous
// entrypoint (deck.handler's runTurnForWorkspace).
//
// Two acquire disciplines share the one gate:
//   - tryAcquire()            — fast, non-blocking. Over the cap it returns null
//                               and the caller (coalescer/scheduler) requeues.
//   - acquireWhenAvailable()  — awaits a slot (FIFO) up to a timeout. Used by the
//                               ONE-SHOT autonomous callers (loop kickoff,
//                               decision resume, startup reconcile) that would
//                               otherwise silently drop their turn on a transient
//                               full gate with no event to retry them.
//
// Slots are tracked BY TOKEN (not a bare counter) so a double-release or a
// stale-release (a wedged turn finishing long after its slot was reclaimed) is a
// safe no-op rather than a phantom decrement that widens the effective cap. Each
// slot also carries a LEASE: a slot held past LEASE_MS is treated as wedged
// (a hung claude.exe whose SDK stream never settled) and reclaimed, so two wedged
// turns can't deadlock every autonomous wake fleet-wide. The wedged turn may
// still be physically running when its slot is reclaimed — the cap can transiently
// exceed by that one turn, which is acceptable: unwedging the fleet wins.
//
// NOT module-global state: deck.handler owns exactly ONE instance (constructed
// per registration), so a test — or a second registration — starts from a clean
// count. Human DECK_SEND deliberately does NOT pass through here: a person's
// typed turn is never throttled by ambient autonomous load.
