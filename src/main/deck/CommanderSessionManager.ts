// ─── Command Deck — Commander session manager (Phase 2, P2c) ─────────────────
//
// Owns the single Commander brain session (Phase 2 is single-commander) and its
// lifecycle: it starts the adapter lazily on the first send, forwards the
// normalized event stream to a sink (the IPC push to the renderer), enforces
// ONE turn at a time, and tears the adapter down on app quit.
//
// Not an Electron/IPC module on purpose — it takes a BrainAdapter and an event
// sink as constructor deps, so it unit-tests against a fake adapter with no
// SDK, no ipcMain, and no BrowserWindow. The IPC handler (deck.handler.ts) is
// the thin Electron shell that wires a real ClaudeSdkAdapter + a webContents
// sink into this manager.
//
// Concurrency: a send while a turn is in flight is REJECTED (not queued) — the
// simplest correct policy. The renderer disables the composer on `busy`, so the
// reject is a backstop for a racing double-submit, surfaced as an `error`
// event rather than silently dropped.
