// ─── Command Deck — Claude Agent SDK brain adapter (Phase 2, P2b) ────────────
//
// The one concrete BrainAdapter Phase 2 ships. Drives the fleet through the
// `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `query()` — running in the MAIN process
// (subprocess spawn + file access), NOT the renderer.
//
// Phase 0 proved the three load-bearing facts this adapter relies on:
//   1. `query()` runs on SUBSCRIPTION auth when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is absent
//      (apiKeySource=none) — zero-API, the wmux moat. We force this by scrubbing
//      the key from the spawned env.
//   2. `options.mcpServers = { wmux: { type:'stdio', command:'node', args:[<mcp
//      bundle>] } }` + `allowedTools:['mcp__wmux__…']` gives the brain the live
//      fleet as hands.
//   3. `options.resume: sessionId` threads turns across subprocesses — the
//      process-crossing continuity Phase 3's reboot survival will build on.
//
// Turn model: each `send()` is ONE `query()` call. The first turn launches
// fresh (system prompt + one-shot fleet context prepended to the prompt);
// every later turn passes `resume: this._sessionId`, so the transcript is
// recalled from disk rather than re-sent. The session manager guarantees one
// turn at a time, so a single `_active` handle is enough for `interrupt()`.
