     *      slug). An unattributed death is not evidence about THIS pane.
     *   2. IDENTITY. A named death must match the agent the pane is running, or
     *      it belongs to some other process the tracker followed into this
     *      session — a sidecar, a leftover child, a previous launch.
     *   3. LIVE STATUS. Only a pane showing 'running' (or holding an open turn
     *      latch) has anything to settle. `complete` / `awaiting_input` /
     *      `waiting` / `error` are results the operator has not read yet, and
     *      the agent exiting afterwards does not un-finish the turn. This
     *      reuses the same `getLastBroadcastAgentStatus` record #935 added for
     *      onIdle's deference.
     *
     * `agentName` is deliberately NOT cleared: it is per-PTY identity ("this
     * pane is a Claude Code pane"), not a liveness claim, and blanking it drops
     * the roster row's label — and with it the pane's place in the roster —
     * for a pane that is still very much there.
     *

     * below is not vetoed by the very gate it exists to escape.
