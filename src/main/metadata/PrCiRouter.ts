// ─── AO-style CI feedback routing (owner decision 2026-07-18) ────────────────
//
// The metadata poll already computes each pane's PR `checks` state every 5 s
// (passing | pending | failing | null). This router turns the passing/pending →
// FAILING transition into a ONE-SHOT `pr.ci` EventBus event so the deck's
// event-push coalescer can wake the owning orchestrator and (in auto/assist)
// drive the pane to a fix. It is the "detect → route back to the responsible
// worker" loop that competitors (Agent Orchestrator) ship and wmux lacked.
//
// EDGE-TRIGGERED, not level: we remember the last-seen `checks` per ptyId and
// fire ONLY on the transition INTO 'failing'. A PR that stays red across many
// poll ticks emits exactly once; it re-arms when checks leave 'failing' (a push
// flips it to pending/passing) so a later regression fires again. Without this
// the brain would be re-woken every 5 s for the same red PR.
//
// Pure of Electron: the workspace resolver and the emit sink are injected so the
// transition logic unit-tests with fakes. Production wiring lives in
// metadata.handler (resolver = findWorkspaceIdForPty over a cached workspace.list;
// sink = eventBus.emit). Resolution is async (renderer round-trip) but the map
// is written SYNCHRONOUSLY before the await, so an overlapping/next tick can't
// double-fire the same transition.
