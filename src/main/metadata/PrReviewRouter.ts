// ─── AO-style review-feedback routing, slice 2 (owner decision 2026-07-18) ───
//
// Sibling of PrCiRouter: where that one routes a RED CI back to the owning
// workspace, this one routes NEW PR REVIEW FEEDBACK (conversation comments,
// review verdicts, inline review comments — everything GhPrService.prDetail
// already normalizes into one stream) the same way. A reviewer leaves a
// comment → the owning workspace's brain wakes and (in auto) may drive the
// pane to address it.
//
// WATERMARK, not edge: comments are an append-only stream, so we remember the
// max `createdAt` seen per pane and fire once per batch of strictly-newer
// comments. The FIRST observation of a PR arms the watermark silently — an
// existing review history must not wake the brain the moment a pane checks
// out an old PR branch.
//
// COST: rides entirely on existing caches. `listPrs` has a 30 s TTL per repo
// and `prDetail` is keyed by the PR's `updatedAt` (unchanged → no gh call), so
// the only new steady-state cost is one throttled cache read per pane per
// CHECK_INTERVAL. The per-pane throttle is written SYNCHRONOUSLY before any
// await, so overlapping poll ticks can't double-fetch.
//
// Pure of Electron: provider (gh), resolver and emit sink are injected —
// production wiring lives in metadata.handler next to PrCiRouter's.
