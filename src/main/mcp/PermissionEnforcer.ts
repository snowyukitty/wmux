// PermissionEnforcer — pure-function permission gate for the Phase 2.2
// enforcement layer. Given a method, params, request context, and the
// caller's trust record, returns one of:
//
//   - { kind: 'allow' }
//       Capability declared and (if applicable) every requested path is
//       covered by the declaration. Handler runs as normal.
//
//   - { kind: 'reject'; rejection: RpcRejection }
//       Either the capability wasn't declared, every requested path was
//       rejected, the trust state forbids it (denied / unconfirmed), or
//       a multi-path method in 'all-or-nothing' mode had any path fail.
//       Caller MUST NOT invoke the handler.
//
//   - { kind: 'partial'; allowedPaths: string[]; rejection: RpcRejection }
//       Multi-path method in 'partial' mode where some paths matched and
//       some didn't. Dispatcher passes `allowedPaths` to the handler
//       (rewriting params if needed) and attaches the `rejection` field
//       (the `paths-partially-allowed` variant) to the success response
//       so the client knows what was filtered. See plan D3 for the wire
//       contract — Pre-commit 2 wires `rejection` into the RpcResponse
//       `ok: true` arm to carry this case.
//
// Design notes (plan D1, D4):
//   - Pure function. No I/O, no time, no side effects. Trust state is read
//     once upstream and passed in. This makes the enforcer trivially
//     unit-testable and means the same function runs in both shadow mode
//     (log the rejection) and enforce mode (return the rejection).
//   - Identity-bootstrap RPCs (mcp.identify / mcp.declarePermissions) carry
//     `capability: null` in methodCapabilityMap; the enforcer recognises
//     this and allows unconditionally. NO hard-coded special-case here.
//   - `legacy` status (no clientName envelope upstream) WAS allowed so
//     substrate could ship without breaking v2.x callers. #1111 Stage 3
//     closes that grandfather lane, for the first release on or after the
//     announced 2026-09-30 date: both the no-clientName check and the
//     `legacy` trust status reject with identity-status:legacy, and they
//     move together by rule. Two lanes are exempt from the no-clientName
//     reject: the renderer `operator` bridge, which has no envelope to send,
//     and the token-authenticated commander lane, whose auth is the token.
//     The iframe plugin host is not exempt and needs no exemption: it always
//     sends its manifest name and meets the trust ladder like any plugin.
//   - `denied` is rejected with no pendingApproval (spec §4.3: denied
//     never regresses). User must edit plugin-trust.json by hand.
//   - `unconfirmed` is rejected with `pendingApproval` so the client can
//     retry once the user approves. The `promptId` is filled in by the
//     ApprovalQueue at dispatch time (Pre-commit 5), not here — the
//     enforcer returns it as `undefined` and the dispatcher overwrites.

  // never had one: the wmux UI's IPC bridge (src/main/index.ts
  // `invokeRendererRpc`) and the phone browser bridge dispatch with
