// First-party MCP recognition for the Phase 2.2 permission enforcer.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// wmux ships its own MCP server (`src/mcp/index.ts`, the `wmux` plugin Claude
// Code talks to). In a packaged build the daemon runs the enforcer in
// `enforce` mode (enforcementMode.ts), and the bundled server is recorded in
// the trust DB as `unconfirmed` because it only ever calls `mcp.identify`,
// never `mcp.declarePermissions`. That left every capability-bearing RPC it
// makes (browser.*, pane.*, a2a.*, ...) rejected with no path to recover:
// the approval dialog only fires for plugins that declared a non-empty
// capability set, so the bundled server deadlocked permanently. See
// `plans/first-party-mcp-trust.md`.
//
// It can't go through the normal declare/approve flow either: several tools
// it exposes map to `wmux.internal` methods (surface.list, surface.new/close
// [issue #285], browser.tabs) which `permissionGrammar` deliberately forbids
// from ever appearing in a declaration (RESERVED_PREFIXES = ['wmux.']). No
// amount of user approval can grant those — the source-qualified,
// name-recognised wire lane is the only path.
//
// The fix: first require positive local external-wire provenance from
// PipeServer, then recognise the bundled server by the host clientName it
// reports and allow exactly the method set it actually calls — nothing more.
// This is a scoped allowlist, NOT a blanket "first party can do anything"
// bypass: a method outside the set falls through to normal enforcement, and an
// explicit user `denied` still wins (see PermissionEnforcer.check).
//
// Threat model (matches the spec's "declared, not verified" stance, rpc.ts):
// once the source is qualified, recognition is by self-asserted clientName.
// THIS IS BEST-EFFORT ATTRIBUTION, NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY AGAINST SAME-USER
// CODE. On a single-user OS it is no weaker than any local secret — a same-user
// process that wanted to impersonate the host already holds the daemon auth
// token and could call the pipe directly.
// What the scoped allowlist buys over a blanket bypass is that even an
// impersonator only reaches the curated method set, never daemon.*,
// workspace.new, company mutation, or other reserved surface. Cryptographic
// first-party identity (peer-PID, per-launch nonce) was evaluated and deferred
// to a remote/multi-user transport (issue #113). Full residual-risk writeup +
// the curated-allowlist invariant: docs/api/mcp-plugin-spec.md §2.4.

// Host identities that own the bundled wmux MCP server. The server reports the
// connecting MCP client's `clientInfo.name` (see wireClientIdentityHook in
// src/mcp/index.ts); Claude Code reports `claude-code`. A Set so additional
// first-party hosts can be added without touching the enforcer. Exact match —
// `clientName` is already trimmed by PipeServer when it builds RpcContext.
//
// Each entry is the bundled wmux MCP server running under a DIFFERENT agent
// host (the bundle code is identical; only the connecting client's reported
// name differs). Adding a host grants it the SAME scoped allowlist
// (FIRST_PARTY_METHODS) — never a blanket bypass, and an explicit user `denied`
// still wins. Threat model is unchanged: best-effort same-user attribution, not
// a security boundary (a same-user impersonator already holds the auth token).
