// Source-lockstep guard for the hook-bridge lane (#1111).
//
// The bridges under `integrations/<agent>/bin/` are standalone .mjs/.js
// scripts outside the main build, so nothing but this test keeps them in step
// with the enforcer. Two ways to silently break main-pipe turn-state
// reporting, both caught here:
//
//   1. A bridge stops sending the recognised clientName (or a typo drifts it)
//      -> its `hooks.signal` is refused as identity-status:legacy.
//   2. A bridge starts calling a main-pipe method outside HOOK_BRIDGE_METHODS
//      -> that call is refused, because the lane is deliberately one method.
//
// Failures here are actionable: either fix the bridge, or deliberately widen
// hookBridge.ts (and think about least privilege while doing it).
