// method the bundled MCP server actually calls — otherwise a tool silently
// breaks under enforce mode. Rather than trust a hand-maintained list, this
// test parses the real bundled-server source (src/mcp/**) for every
// callRpc/sendRpc method literal and fails if any valid RpcMethod is missing
// from the allowlist. Add a tool that calls a new RPC → this test tells you to
// allowlist it.
