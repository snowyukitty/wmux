// A minimal CDP client over one WebSocket, extracted from LiveChromeClient so
// the dedicated 'chrome' backend can share it (ChromeLauncher's tab-target
// watcher). Deliberately tiny: this is not a CDP library, it is the request/
// reply + event plumbing two call sites needed twice.
//
// Two things the extraction adds over the original inline client:
//   • Events. The old message handler dropped every frame without an `id`
//     ("event, not a reply"), which made CDP subscriptions impossible. Frames
//     with a `method` are now dispatched to on() handlers.
//   • Flattened sessions. `sessionId` rides as a TOP-LEVEL frame field on the
//     way out (CDP flatten mode) and is handed back to event handlers on the
//     way in, so one socket can drive the browser session and any number of
//     attached target sessions.
//
// The endpoint is resolved lazily on every call: Chrome mints a new secret
// browser path each boot, so a stale socket is dropped and re-dialed rather
// than kept.
