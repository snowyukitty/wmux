// One file per domain, under `<wmuxDir>/site-memory/<workspaceId>/<slug>.json`
// — the same shape and the same reasoning as PromotedSkillStore: a torn write
// costs one domain's memory rather than every domain's, and a forget is an
// unlink rather than a rewrite of a shared document.
//
// getWmuxDir() folds in WMUX_DATA_SUFFIX, so an isolated instance gets its own
// tree for free and can neither read nor sweep the real one's memory.
//
// Every method is never-throw. This store is an optimization: the worst
// acceptable outcome of a broken tree is that the agent rediscovers a failure
// it had already paid for once. An exception here would cost it the navigation
// or the replay it was actually doing.
//
// There is NO archive ladder, unlike promoted flows. A promoted flow is
// something a person chose to keep, so it gets a stop in the archive before it
// disappears; a failure record is machine-written and re-acquired the moment
// the failure happens again, so expiry deletes outright.
